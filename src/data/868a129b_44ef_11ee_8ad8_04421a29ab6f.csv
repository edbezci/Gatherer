0,Electron trapping in graphene quantum dots with magnetic flux,Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics,Mohammed El Azar; Ahmed Bouhlal; Abdulaziz D. Alhaidari; Ahmed Jellal,24-August-2023,"It is known that the appearance of Klein tunneling in graphene makes it hard
to keep or localize electrons in a graphene-based quantum dot (GQD). However, a
magnetic field can be used to temporarily confine an electron that is traveling
into a GQD. The electronic states investigated here are resonances with a
finite trapping time, also referred to as quasi-bound states. By subjecting the
GDQ to a magnetic flux, we study the scattering phenomenon and the
Aharonov-Bohm effect on the lifetime of quasi-bound states existing in a GQD.
We demonstrate that the trapping time increases with the magnetic flux
sustaining the trapped states for a long time even after the flux is turned
off. Furthermore, we discover that the probability density within the GQD is
also clearly improved. We demonstrate that the trapping time of an electron
inside a GQD can be successfully extended by adjusting the magnetic flux
parameters."

Wong; Leigh N. Fletcher; Michael T. Roman; Nicholas A. Teanby; Daniel Toledo; Glenn S. Orton; Santiago Perez-Hoyos; Agustin Sanchez-Lavega; Lawrence Sromovsky; Amy A. Simon; Raul Morales-Juberias; Imke de Pater; Statia L. Cook,24-August-2023,"Previous observations of dark vortices in Neptune's atmosphere, such as
Voyager-2's Great Dark Spot, have been made in only a few, broad-wavelength
channels, which has hampered efforts to pinpoint their pressure level and what
makes them dark. Here, we present Very Large Telescope (Chile) MUSE
spectrometer observations of Hubble Space Telescope's NDS-2018 dark spot, made
in 2019. These medium-resolution 475 - 933 nm reflection spectra allow us to
show that dark spots are caused by a darkening at short wavelengths (< 700 nm)
of a deep ~5-bar aerosol layer, which we suggest is the H$_2$S condensation
layer. A deep bright spot, named DBS-2019, is also visible on the edge of
NDS-2018, whose spectral signature is consistent with a brightening of the same
5-bar layer at longer wavelengths (> 700 nm). This bright feature is much
deeper than previously studied dark spot companion clouds and may be connected
with the circulation that generates and sustains such spots."
2,Software Startups -- A Research Agenda,Software Engineering,Michael Unterkalmsteiner; Pekka Abrahamsson; Xiaofeng Wang; Anh Nguyen-Duc; Syed M. Ali Shah; Sohaib Shahid Bajwa; Guido H. Baltes; Kieran Conboy; Eoin Cullina; Denis Dennehy; Henry Edison; Carlos Fernández-Sánchez; Juan Garbajosa; Tony Gorschek; Eriks Klotins; Laura Hokkanen; Fabio Kon; Ilaria Lunesu; Michele Marchesi; Lorraine Morgan; Markku Oivo; Christoph Selig; Pertti Seppänen; Roger Sweetman; Pasi Tyrväinen; Christina Ungerer; Agustín Yagüe,24-August-2023,"Software startup companies develop innovative, software-intensive products
within limited time frames and with few resources, searching for sustainable
and scalable business models. Software startups are quite distinct from
traditional mature software companies, but also from micro-, small-, and
medium-sized enterprises, introducing new challenges relevant for software
engineering research. This paper's research agenda focuses on software
engineering in startups, identifying, in particular, 70+ research questions in
the areas of supporting startup engineering activities, startup evolution
models and patterns, ecosystems and innovation hubs, human aspects in software
startups, applying startup concepts in non-startup environments, and
methodologies and theories for startup research. We connect and motivate this
research agenda with past studies in software startup research, while pointing
out possible future directions. While all authors of this research agenda have
their main background in Software Engineering or Computer Science, their
interest in software startups broadens the perspective to the challenges, but
also to the opportunities that emerge from multi-disciplinary research. Our
audience is therefore primarily software engineering researchers, even though
we aim at stimulating collaborations and research that crosses disciplinary
boundaries. We believe that with this research agenda we cover a wide spectrum
of the software startup industry current needs."
3,Self-induced Bose glass phase in quantum cluster quasicrystals,Quantum Gases,Matheus Grossklags; Matteo Ciardi; Vinicius Zampronio; Fabio Cinti; Alejandro Mendoza-Coto,23-August-2023,"We study the emergence of Bose glass phases in self sustained bosonic
quasicrystals induced by a pair interaction between particles of
Lifshitz-Petrich type. By using a mean field variational method designed in
momentum space as well as Gross-Pitaevskii simulations we determine the phase
diagram of the model. The study of the local and global superfluid fraction
allows the identification of supersolid, super quasicrystal, Bose glass and
insulating phases. The Bose glass phase emerges as a quasicrystal phase in
which the global superfluidity is essentially zero, while the local
superfluidity remains finite in certain ring structures of the quasicrystalline
pattern. Furthermore, we perform continuous space Path Integral Monte Carlo
simulations for a case in which the interaction between particles stabilizes a
quasicrystal phase. Our results show that as the strength of the interaction
between particles is increased the system undergoes a sequence of states
consistent with the super quasicrystal, Bose glass, and quasicrystal insulator
thermodynamic phases."
4,Evolution of ESG-focused DLT Research: An NLP Analysis of the Literature,Information Retrieval,Walter Hernandez; Kamil Tylinski; Alastair Moore; Niall Roche; Nikhil Vadgama; Horst Treiblmaier; Jiangbo Shangguan; Paolo Tasca; Jiahua Xu,23-August-2023,"Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) have rapidly evolved, necessitating
comprehensive insights into their diverse components. However, a systematic
literature review that emphasizes the Environmental, Sustainability, and
Governance (ESG) components of DLT remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we
selected 107 seed papers to build a citation network of 63,083 references and
refined it to a corpus of 24,539 publications for analysis. Then, we labeled
the named entities in 46 papers according to twelve top-level categories
derived from an established technology taxonomy and enhanced the taxonomy by
pinpointing DLT's ESG elements. Leveraging transformer-based language models,
we fine-tuned a pre-trained language model for a Named Entity Recognition (NER)
task using our labeled dataset. We used our fine-tuned language model to
distill the corpus to 505 key papers, facilitating a literature review via
named entities and temporal graph analysis on DLT evolution in the context of
ESG. Our contributions are a methodology to conduct a machine learning-driven
systematic literature review in the DLT field, placing a special emphasis on
ESG aspects. Furthermore, we present a first-of-its-kind NER dataset, composed
of 54,808 named entities, designed for DLT and ESG-related explorations."
5,Multi-Objective Optimization for Sparse Deep Neural Network Training,Machine Learning,S. S. Hotegni; S. Peitz; M. Berkemeier,23-August-2023,"Different conflicting optimization criteria arise naturally in various Deep
Learning scenarios. These can address different main tasks (i.e., in the
setting of Multi-Task Learning), but also main and secondary tasks such as loss
minimization versus sparsity. The usual approach is a simple weighting of the
criteria, which formally only works in the convex setting. In this paper, we
present a Multi-Objective Optimization algorithm using a modified Weighted
Chebyshev scalarization for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with respect
to several tasks. By employing this scalarization technique, the algorithm can
identify all optimal solutions of the original problem while reducing its
complexity to a sequence of single-objective problems. The simplified problems
are then solved using an Augmented Lagrangian method, enabling the use of
popular optimization techniques such as Adam and Stochastic Gradient Descent,
while efficaciously handling constraints. Our work aims to address the
(economical and also ecological) sustainability issue of DNN models, with a
particular focus on Deep Multi-Task models, which are typically designed with a
very large number of weights to perform equally well on multiple tasks. Through
experiments conducted on two Machine Learning datasets, we demonstrate the
possibility of adaptively sparsifying the model during training without
significantly impacting its performance, if we are willing to apply
task-specific adaptations to the network weights. Code is available at
https://github.com/salomonhotegni/MDMTN."
6,HarvestNet: A Dataset for Detecting Smallholder Farming Activity Using Harvest Piles and Remote Sensing,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,Jonathan Xu; Amna Elmustafa; Liya Weldegebriel; Emnet Negash; Richard Lee; Chenlin Meng; Stefano Ermon; David Lobell,23-August-2023,"Small farms contribute to a large share of the productive land in developing
countries. In regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, where 80% of farms are small
(under 2 ha in size), the task of mapping smallholder cropland is an important
part of tracking sustainability measures such as crop productivity. However,
the visually diverse and nuanced appearance of small farms has limited the
effectiveness of traditional approaches to cropland mapping. Here we introduce
a new approach based on the detection of harvest piles characteristic of many
smallholder systems throughout the world. We present HarvestNet, a dataset for
mapping the presence of farms in the Ethiopian regions of Tigray and Amhara
during 2020-2023, collected using expert knowledge and satellite images,
totaling 7k hand-labeled images and 2k ground collected labels. We also
benchmark a set of baselines including SOTA models in remote sensing with our
best models having around 80% classification performance on hand labelled data
and 90%, 98% accuracy on ground truth data for Tigray, Amhara respectively. We
also perform a visual comparison with a widely used pre-existing coverage map
and show that our model detects an extra 56,621 hectares of cropland in Tigray.
We conclude that remote sensing of harvest piles can contribute to more timely
and accurate cropland assessments in food insecure region."
7,Type III Radio Bursts from Solar Eruptions and their Connection to GLE and SGRE Events,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,Nat Gopalswamy; Anshu Kumari; Pertti A. Mäkelä,22-August-2023,"We report on the close similarity of coronal mass ejection (CME) properties
in ground level enhancement (GLE) in solar energetic particle (SEP) events and
sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) from the Sun as indicated by low frequency
type III radio bursts observed in the interplanetary medium. The complex type
III bursts have an average 1 MHz duration of 36 and 34 min in the SGRE and GLE
events, respectively. Similarly, the CMEs underlying SGRE and GLE have average
space speeds of 1866 and 2084 km/s, respectively. These are larger than the
corresponding values (32 min, 1407 km/s) for a control sample of type III
bursts associated with frontside halo CMEs with sky plane speed exceeding 800
km/s. These results are consistent with the idea that energetic CME driven
shocks accelerate particles to very high energies that are responsible for GLE
and SGRE events."
8,Multistability of elasto-inertial two-dimensional channel flow,Fluid Dynamics,Miguel Beneitez; Jacob Page; Yves Dubief; Rich R. Kerswell,22-August-2023,"Elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT) is a recently discovered two-dimensional
chaotic flow state observed in dilute polymer solutions. It has been
hypothesised that the dynamical origins of EIT are linked to a center-mode
instability, whose nonlinear evolution leads to a travelling wave with an
'arrowhead' structure in the polymer conformation, a structure also observed
instantaneously in simulations of EIT. In this work we conduct a suite of
two-dimensional direct numerical simulations spanning a wide range of polymeric
flow parameters to examine the possible dynamical connection between the
arrowhead and EIT. Our calculations reveal (up to) four co-existent attractors:
the laminar state and a steady arrowhead, along with EIT and a 'chaotic
arrowhead'. The steady arrowhead is stable for all parameters considered here,
while the final pair of (chaotic) flow states are visually very similar and can
be distinguished only by the presence of a weak polymer arrowhead structure in
the 'chaotic arrowhead' regime. Analysis of energy transfers between the flow
and the polymer indicates that both chaotic regimes are maintained by an
identical near-wall mechanism and that the weak arrowhead does not play a role.
Our results suggest that the arrowhead is a benign flow structure that is
disconnected from the self-sustaining mechanics of EIT."
9,Radiative Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of the Confined Eruption of a Magnetic Flux Rope: Unveiling the Driving and Constraining Forces,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,Can Wang; Feng Chen; Mingde Ding; Zekun Lu,22-August-2023,"We analyse the forces that control the dynamic evolution of a flux rope
eruption in a three-dimensional (3D) radiative magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD)
simulation. The confined eruption of the flux rope gives rise to a C8.5 flare.
The flux rope rises slowly with an almost constant velocity of a few km/s in
the early stage, when the gravity and Lorentz force are nearly counterbalanced.
After the flux rope rises to the height at which the decay index of the
external poloidal field satisfies the torus instability criterion, the
significantly enhanced Lorentz force breaks the force balance and drives rapid
acceleration of the flux rope. Fast magnetic reconnection is immediately
induced within the current sheet under the erupting flux rope, which provides a
strong positive feedback to the eruption. The eruption is eventually confined
due to the tension force from the strong external toroidal field. Our results
suggest that the gravity of plasma plays an important role in sustaining the
quasi-static evolution of the pre-eruptive flux rope. The Lorentz force, which
is contributed from both the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instability and
magnetic reconnection, dominates the dynamic evolution during the eruption
process."
10,Enhancements of Electron-Atom Collisions due to Pauli Repulsion in Neutron-Star Magnetic Fields,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,Thomas Gomez; Mark Zammit; Igor Bray; Christopher Fontes; Jackson White,22-August-2023,"Neutron star surfaces and atmospheres are unique environments that sustain
the largest-known magnetic fields in the universe. Our knowledge of neutron
star material properties, including the composition and equation of state,
remains highly unconstrained. Electron-atom collisions are integral to
theoretical thermal conduction and spectral emission models that describe
neutron star surfaces. The theory of scattering in magnetic fields was
developed in the 1970s, but focused only on bare nuclei scattering. In this
work, we present a quantum treatment of atom-electron collisions in magnetic
fields; of significant importance is the inclusion of Pauli repulsion arising
from two interacting electrons. We find strange behaviors not seen in
collisions without a magnetic field. In high magnetic fields, Pauli repulsion
can lead to orders of magnitude enhancements of collision cross sections.
Additionally, the elastic collision cross sections that involve the ground
state become comparable to those involving excited states, and states with
large orbits have the largest contribution to the collisions. We anticipate
significant changes to transport properties and spectral line broadening in
neutron star surfaces and atmospheres, which will aid in spectral diagnostics
of these extreme environments."
11,Energy-Efficient On-Board Radio Resource Management for Satellite Communications via Neuromorphic Computing,Systems and Control,Flor Ortiz; Nicolas Skatchkovsky; Eva Lagunas; Wallace A. Martins; Geoffrey Eappen; Saed Daoud; Osvaldo Simeone; Bipin Rajendran; Symeon Chatzinotas,22-August-2023,"The latest satellite communication (SatCom) missions are characterized by a
fully reconfigurable on-board software-defined payload, capable of adapting
radio resources to the temporal and spatial variations of the system traffic.
As pure optimization-based solutions have shown to be computationally tedious
and to lack flexibility, machine learning (ML)-based methods have emerged as
promising alternatives. We investigate the application of energy-efficient
brain-inspired ML models for on-board radio resource management. Apart from
software simulation, we report extensive experimental results leveraging the
recently released Intel Loihi 2 chip. To benchmark the performance of the
proposed model, we implement conventional convolutional neural networks (CNN)
on a Xilinx Versal VCK5000, and provide a detailed comparison of accuracy,
precision, recall, and energy efficiency for different traffic demands. Most
notably, for relevant workloads, spiking neural networks (SNNs) implemented on
Loihi 2 yield higher accuracy, while reducing power consumption by more than
100$\times$ as compared to the CNN-based reference platform. Our findings point
to the significant potential of neuromorphic computing and SNNs in supporting
on-board SatCom operations, paving the way for enhanced efficiency and
sustainability in future SatCom systems."
12,Constraints on Interstellar Sovereignty,Popular Physics,Jacob Haqq-Misra,21-August-2023,"Human space exploration and settlement of other planets is becoming
increasingly technologically feasible, while mission concepts for remote and
crewed missions to nearby star systems continue to be developed. But the
long-term success of space settlement also requires extensions and advances in
models of governance. This paper provides a synthesis of the physical factors
that will constrain the application of sovereignty in space as well as legal
precedent on Earth that likely applies to any crewed or uncrewed missions to
other stellar systems. The Outer Space Treaty limits the territorial expansion
of states into space, but the requirements for oversight of nongovernmental
agencies and retention of property ownership enable the extension of state
jurisdiction into space. Pragmatic constraints from historical precedent on
Earth suggest that new space treaties will be unlikely to succeed and new
global space agencies may have limited jurisdiction over states, while hard
constraints of the space environment require adherence to technical
capabilities, political feasibility, and long-term sustainability. These
factors form a three-prong test for assessing the viability of interstellar
governance models. This discussion of interstellar governance is intended to
further the conversation about sovereignty in space prior to the first
intentional launch of any interstellar spacecraft."
13,Electron heat flux and propagating fronts in plasma thermal quench via ambipolar transport,Plasma Physics,Yanzeng Zhang; Jun Li; Xianzhu Tang,21-August-2023,"The thermal collapse of a nearly collisionless plasma interacting with a
cooling spot, in which the electron parallel heat flux plays an essential role,
is investigated both theoretically and numerically. We show that such thermal
collapse, which is known as thermal quench in tokamaks, comes about in the form
of propagating fronts, originating from the cooling spot, along the magnetic
field lines. The slow fronts, propagating with local ion sound speed, limit the
aggressive cooling of plasma, which is accompanied by a plasma cooling flow
toward the cooling spot. The extraordinary physics underlying such a cooling
flow is that the fundamental constraint of ambipolar transport along the field
line limits the spatial gradient of electron thermal conduction flux to the
much weaker convective scaling, as opposed to the free-streaming scaling, so
that a large electron temperature and hence pressure gradient can be sustained.
The last ion front for a radiative cooling spot is a shock front where cold but
flowing ions meet the hot ions."
14,Polarisation of decayless kink oscillations of solar coronal loops,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,Sihui Zhong; Valery M. Nakariakov; Dmitrii Y. Kolotkov; Lakshmi Pradeep Chitta; Patrick Antolin; Cis Verbeeck; David Berghmans,21-August-2023,"Decayless kink oscillations of plasma loops in the solar corona may contain
an answer to the enigmatic problem of solar and stellar coronal heating. The
polarisation of the oscillations gives us a unique information about their
excitation mechanisms and energy supply. However, unambiguous determination of
the polarisation has remained elusive. Here, we show simultaneous detection of
a 4-min decayless kink oscillation from two non-parallel lines-of-sights,
separated by about 104\textdegree, provided by unique combination of the High
Resolution Imager on Solar Orbiter and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on
Solar Dynamics Observatory. The observations reveal a horizontal or weakly
oblique linear polarisation of the oscillation. This conclusion is based on the
comparison of observational results with forward modelling of the observational
manifestation of various kinds of polarisation of kink oscillations. The
revealed polarisation favours the sustainability of these oscillations by
quasi-steady flows which may hence supply the energy for coronal heating."
15,A Human-on-the-Loop Optimization Autoformalism Approach for Sustainability,Artificial Intelligence,Ming Jin; Bilgehan Sel; Fnu Hardeep; Wotao Yin,20-August-2023,"This paper outlines a natural conversational approach to solving personalized
energy-related problems using large language models (LLMs). We focus on
customizable optimization problems that necessitate repeated solving with
slight variations in modeling and are user-specific, hence posing a challenge
to devising a one-size-fits-all model. We put forward a strategy that augments
an LLM with an optimization solver, enhancing its proficiency in understanding
and responding to user specifications and preferences while providing nonlinear
reasoning capabilities. Our approach pioneers the novel concept of human-guided
optimization autoformalism, translating a natural language task specification
automatically into an optimization instance. This enables LLMs to analyze,
explain, and tackle a variety of instance-specific energy-related problems,
pushing beyond the limits of current prompt-based techniques.
  Our research encompasses various commonplace tasks in the energy sector, from
electric vehicle charging and Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
control to long-term planning problems such as cost-benefit evaluations for
installing rooftop solar photovoltaics (PVs) or heat pumps. This pilot study
marks an essential stride towards the context-based formulation of optimization
using LLMs, with the potential to democratize optimization processes. As a
result, stakeholders are empowered to optimize their energy consumption,
promoting sustainable energy practices customized to personal needs and
preferences."
16,Towards Sustainable Development: A Novel Integrated Machine Learning Model for Holistic Environmental Health Monitoring,Machine Learning,Anirudh Mazumder; Sarthak Engala; Aditya Nallaparaju,20-August-2023,"Urbanization enables economic growth but also harms the environment through
degradation. Traditional methods of detecting environmental issues have proven
inefficient. Machine learning has emerged as a promising tool for tracking
environmental deterioration by identifying key predictive features. Recent
research focused on developing a predictive model using pollutant levels and
particulate matter as indicators of environmental state in order to outline
challenges. Machine learning was employed to identify patterns linking areas
with worse conditions. This research aims to assist governments in identifying
intervention points, improving planning and conservation efforts, and
ultimately contributing to sustainable development."
17,Exploring the Role of Perceived Range Anxiety in Adoption Behavior of Plug-in Electric Vehicles,General Economics,Fatemeh Nazari; Abolfazl Mohammadian; Thomas Stephens,20-August-2023,"A sustainable solution to negative externalities imposed by road
transportation is replacing internal combustion vehicles with electric vehicles
(EVs), especially plug-in EV (PEV) encompassing plug-in hybrid EV (PHEV) and
battery EV (BEV). However, EV market share is still low and is forecast to
remain low and uncertain. This shows a research need for an in-depth
understanding of EV adoption behavior with a focus on one of the main barriers
to the mass EV adoption, which is the limited electric driving range. The
present study extends the existing literature in two directions; First, the
influence of the psychological aspect of driving range, which is referred to as
range anxiety, is explored on EV adoption behavior by presenting a nested logit
(NL) model with a latent construct. Second, the two-level NL model captures
individuals' decision on EV adoption behavior distinguished by vehicle
transaction type and EV type, where the upper level yields the vehicle
transaction type selected from the set of alternatives including
no-transaction, sell, trade, and add. The fuel type of the vehicles decided to
be acquired, either as traded-for or added vehicles, is simultaneously
determined at the lower level from a set including conventional vehicle, hybrid
EV, PHEV, and BEV. The model is empirically estimated using a stated
preferences dataset collected in the State of California. A notable finding is
that anxiety about driving range influences the preference for BEV, especially
as an added than traded-for vehicle, but not the decision on PHEV adoption."
18,Nonlinear model reference adaptive control approach for governance of the commons in a feedback-evolving game,Dynamical Systems,Fang Yan; Xiaorong Hou; Tingting Tian; Xiaojie Chen,20-August-2023,"The governance of common-pool resources has vital importance for
sustainability. However, in the realistic management systems of common-pool
resources, the institutions do not necessarily execute the management policies
completely, which will induce that the real implementation intensity is
uncertain. In this paper, we consider a feedback-evolving game model with the
inspection for investigating the management of renewable resource and assume
that there exists the implementation uncertainty of inspection. Furthermore, we
use the nonlinear model reference adaptive control approach to handle this
uncertainty. We accordingly design a protocol, which is an update law of
adjusting the institutional inspection intensity. We obtain a sufficient
condition under which the update law can drive the actual system to reach the
expected outcome. In addition, we provide several numerical examples, which can
confirm our theoretical results. Our work presents a novel approach to address
the implementation uncertainty in the feedback-evolving games and thus our
results can be helpful for effectively managing the common-pool resources in
the human social systems."
19,Deep Reinforcement Learning for Artificial Upwelling Energy Management,Machine Learning,Yiyuan Zhang; Wei Fan,20-August-2023,"The potential of artificial upwelling (AU) as a means of lifting
nutrient-rich bottom water to the surface, stimulating seaweed growth, and
consequently enhancing ocean carbon sequestration, has been gaining increasing
attention in recent years. This has led to the development of the first
solar-powered and air-lifted AU system (AUS) in China. However, efficient
scheduling of air injection systems remains a crucial challenge in operating
AUS, as it holds the potential to significantly improve system efficiency.
Conventional approaches based on rules or models are often impractical due to
the complex and heterogeneous nature of the marine environment and its
associated disturbances. To address this challenge, we propose a novel energy
management approach that utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm
to develop efficient strategies for operating AUS. Through extensive
simulations, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate its
superior effectiveness over traditional rule-based approaches and other DRL
algorithms in reducing energy wastage while ensuring the stable and efficient
operation of AUS. Our findings suggest that a DRL-based approach offers a
promising way for improving the efficiency of AUS and enhancing the
sustainability of seaweed cultivation and carbon sequestration in the ocean."
