0,A new framework for global data regulation,Computers and Society,Ellie Graeden; David Rosado; Tess Stevens; Mallory Knodel; Rachele Hendricks-Sturrup; Andrew Reiskind; Ashley Bennett; John Leitner; Paul Lekas; Michelle DeMooy,24-August-2023,"Under the current regulatory framework for data protections, the protection
of human rights writ large and the corresponding outcomes are regulated largely
independently from the data and tools that both threaten those rights and are
needed to protect them. This separation between tools and the outcomes they
generate risks overregulation of the data and tools themselves when not linked
to sensitive use cases. In parallel, separation risks under-regulation if the
data can be collected and processed under a less-restrictive framework, but
used to drive an outcome that requires additional sensitivity and restrictions.
A new approach is needed to support differential protections based on the
genuinely high-risk use cases within each sector. Here, we propose a regulatory
framework designed to apply not to specific data or tools themselves, but to
the outcomes and rights that are linked to the use of these data and tools in
context. This framework is designed to recognize, address, and protect a broad
range of human rights, including privacy, and suggests a more flexible approach
to policy making that is aligned with current engineering tools and practices.
We test this framework in the context of open banking and describe how current
privacy-enhancing technologies and other engineering strategies can be applied
in this context and that of contract tracing applications. This approach for
data protection regulations more effectively builds on existing engineering
tools and protects the wide range of human rights defined by legislation and
constitutions around the globe."
1,The motility-matrix production switch in Bacillus subtilis -- a modeling perspective,Biological Physics,Simon Dannenberg; Jonas Penning; Alexander Simm; Stefan Klumpp,24-August-2023,"Phenotype switching can be triggered by external stimuli and by intrinsic
stochasticity. Here, we focus on the motility-matrix production switch in
Bacillus subtilis. We use modeling to describe the SinR-SlrR bistable switch
its regulation by SinI, and to distinguish different sources of stochasticity.
Our simulations indicate that intrinsic fluctuations in the synthesis of SinI
are insufficient to drive spontaneous switching and suggest that switching is
triggered by upstream noise from the Spo0A phosphorelay."
2,FastSurfer-HypVINN: Automated sub-segmentation of the hypothalamus and adjacent structures on high-resolutional brain MRI,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,Santiago Estrada; David Kügler; Emad Bahrami; Peng Xu; Dilshad Mousa; Monique M. B. Breteler; N. Ahmad Aziz; Martin Reuter,24-August-2023,"The hypothalamus plays a crucial role in the regulation of a broad range of
physiological, behavioural, and cognitive functions. However, despite its
importance, only a few small-scale neuroimaging studies have investigated its
substructures, likely due to the lack of fully automated segmentation tools to
address scalability and reproducibility issues of manual segmentation. While
the only previous attempt to automatically sub-segment the hypothalamus with a
neural network showed promise for 1.0 mm isotropic T1-weighted (T1w) MRI, there
is a need for an automated tool to sub-segment also high-resolutional (HiRes)
MR scans, as they are becoming widely available, and include structural detail
also from multi-modal MRI. We, therefore, introduce a novel, fast, and fully
automated deep learning method named HypVINN for sub-segmentation of the
hypothalamus and adjacent structures on 0.8 mm isotropic T1w and T2w brain MR
images that is robust to missing modalities. We extensively validate our model
with respect to segmentation accuracy, generalizability, in-session test-retest
reliability, and sensitivity to replicate hypothalamic volume effects (e.g.
sex-differences). The proposed method exhibits high segmentation performance
both for standalone T1w images as well as for T1w/T2w image pairs. Even with
the additional capability to accept flexible inputs, our model matches or
exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods with fixed inputs. We,
further, demonstrate the generalizability of our method in experiments with 1.0
mm MR scans from both the Rhineland Study and the UK Biobank. Finally, HypVINN
can perform the segmentation in less than a minute (GPU) and will be available
in the open source FastSurfer neuroimaging software suite, offering a
validated, efficient, and scalable solution for evaluating imaging-derived
phenotypes of the hypothalamus."
3,Loss Measurement of Low RDS Devices Through Thermal Modelling -- The Advantage of Not Turning it Fully On,Systems and Control,José Miguel Sanz-Alcaine; Francisco Jose Perez-Cebolla; Carlos Bernal-Ruiz; Asier Arruti; Iosu Aizpuru; Juan Sanchez,24-August-2023,"This paper presents and evaluates a novel method for generating power losses
on transistors avoiding high currents. These could heat up the circuit tracks,
affecting the accurate thermal modeling of the system. The proposed procedure
is based on the transistor current regulation with low gate voltages and the
linearity between power and temperature, being useful for all transistor
technologies (Si, SiC and GaN). Through this method, low DC currents are enough
to bring transistors to their thermal limits. Thermal stability issues and
their differences between technologies are discussed and an experimental
validation of the method is carried out."
4,"Optimal and Robust Fault Tolerant Control of Wind Turbines Working under Sensor, Actuator, and System Faults",Systems and Control,Yashar Mousavi,24-August-2023,"Motivated by the increasing concerns over environmental challenges such as
global warming and the exhaustion of fossil-fuel reserves, the renewable energy
industry has become the most demanded electrical energy production source
worldwide. In this context, wind energy conversion systems (WECSs) are the most
dominant and fastest-growing alternative energy production technologies,
playing an increasingly vital role in renewable power generation. To tackle the
pitch control problem of WECSs, this thesis proposes an optimal fault-tolerant
fractional-order pitch control strategy for pitch angle regulation of WT blades
subjected to sensor, actuator, and system faults. To showcast the effects of
faults, changes in the system parameters are considered as a result of sensor,
actuator and system faults with various levels of severity.} Furthermore,
taking advantage of the favourable merits of higher-order SMCs and fractional
calculus, this thesis develops a fault-tolerant fractional-calculus-based
higher-order sliding mode controller for optimum rotor speed tracking and power
production maximization of WECSs. \textcolor{black}{The partial loss of the
generator output torque is considered as an actuator failure, leading to loss
of partial actuation power. Moreover, active fault-tolerant fractional-order
higher-order SMC strategies are developed for rotor current regulation and
speed trajectory tracking of doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) -driven
WECSs subjected to model uncertainties and rotor current sensor faults. The
developed controllers are augmented with two state observers, an algebraic
state estimator and a sliding mode observer, to estimate the rotor current
dynamics during sensors' faults."
5,Financial Inclusion and Monetary Policy: A Study on the Relationship between Financial Inclusion and Effectiveness of Monetary Policy in Developing Countries,General Economics,Gautam Kumar Biswas; Faruque Ahamed,24-August-2023,"The study analyzed the impact of financial inclusion on the effectiveness of
monetary policy in developing countries. By using a panel data set of 10
developing countries during 2004-2020, the study revealed that the financial
inclusion measured by the number of ATM per 100,000 adults had a significant
negative effect on monetary policy, whereas the other measure of financial
inclusion i.e. the number of bank accounts per 100,000 adults had a positive
impact on monetary policy, which is not statistically significant. The study
also revealed that foreign direct investment (FDI), lending rate and exchange
rate had a positive impact on inflation, but only the effect of lending rate is
statistically significant. Therefore, the governments of these countries should
make necessary drives to increase the level of financial inclusion as it
stabilizes the price level by reducing the inflation in the economy."
6,"False Information, Bots and Malicious Campaigns: Demystifying Elements of Social Media Manipulations",Social and Information Networks,Mohammad Majid Akhtar; Rahat Masood; Muhammad Ikram; Salil S. Kanhere,24-August-2023,"The rapid spread of false information and persistent manipulation attacks on
online social networks (OSNs), often for political, ideological, or financial
gain, has affected the openness of OSNs. While researchers from various
disciplines have investigated different manipulation-triggering elements of
OSNs (such as understanding information diffusion on OSNs or detecting
automated behavior of accounts), these works have not been consolidated to
present a comprehensive overview of the interconnections among these elements.
Notably, user psychology, the prevalence of bots, and their tactics in relation
to false information detection have been overlooked in previous research. To
address this research gap, this paper synthesizes insights from various
disciplines to provide a comprehensive analysis of the manipulation landscape.
By integrating the primary elements of social media manipulation (SMM),
including false information, bots, and malicious campaigns, we extensively
examine each SMM element. Through a systematic investigation of prior research,
we identify commonalities, highlight existing gaps, and extract valuable
insights in the field. Our findings underscore the urgent need for
interdisciplinary research to effectively combat social media manipulations,
and our systematization can guide future research efforts and assist OSN
providers in ensuring the safety and integrity of their platforms."
7,Nonlinearity tunes crack dynamics in soft materials,Soft Condensed Matter,Fucheng Tian; Jian Ping Gong,24-August-2023,"Cracks in soft materials exhibit diverse dynamic patterns, involving
straight, oscillation, branching, and supershear fracture. Here, we
successfully reproduce these crack morphologies in a two-dimensional
pre-strained fracture scenario and establish crack stability phase diagrams for
three distinct nonlinear materials using a fracture phase field model. The
contrasting phase diagrams highlight the crucial role of nonlinearity in
regulating crack dynamics. In strain-softening materials, crack branching
prevails, limiting the cracks to sub-Rayleigh states. Yet strain-stiffening
stabilizes crack propagation, allowing for the presence of supershear fracture.
Of particular interest is the large-strain linear elastic materials, where
crack oscillation is readily triggered. The onset speed of such instability
scales linearly with the characteristic wave speed near the crack tip,
supporting the notion that such crack oscillations are a universal instability
closely tied to the wave speed. The oscillation wavelength is shown to be a
bilinear function of the nonlinear scale and crack driving force, with a
minimum length scale associated with the dissipative zone. Moreover, our
findings suggest that the increase in characteristic wave speed due to
strain-stiffening can account for the observed transition of cracks from
sub-Rayleigh to supershear regimes."
8,Procurement in welfare programs: Evidence and implications from WIC infant formula contracts,General Economics,Yonghong An; David Davis; Yizao Liu; Ruli Xiao,24-August-2023,"This paper examines the impact of government procurement in social welfare
programs on consumers, manufacturers, and the government. We analyze the U.S.
infant formula market, where over half of the total sales are purchased by the
Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program. The WIC program utilizes
first-price auctions to solicit rebates from the three main formula
manufacturers, with the winner exclusively serving all WIC consumers in the
winning state. The manufacturers compete aggressively in providing rebates
which account for around 85% of the wholesale price. To rationalize and
disentangle the factors contributing to this phenomenon, we model
manufacturers' retail pricing competition by incorporating two unique features:
price inelastic WIC consumers and government regulation on WIC brand prices.
Our findings confirm three sizable benefits from winning the auction: a notable
spill-over effect on non-WIC demand, a significant marginal cost reduction, and
a higher retail price for the WIC brand due to the price inelasticity of WIC
consumers. Our counterfactual analysis shows that procurement auctions affect
manufacturers asymmetrically, with the smallest manufacturer harmed the most.
More importantly, by switching from the current mechanism to a predetermined
rebate procurement, the government can still contain the cost successfully,
consumers' surplus is greatly improved, and the smallest manufacturer benefits
from the switch, promoting market competition."
9,Trend and Emerging Types of 419 Scams,Cryptography and Security,Polra Victor Falade,23-August-2023,"Technological advancements have revolutionized various aspects of human life,
facilitating communication, business operations, healthcare, education, and
environmental monitoring. However, this increased reliance on technology has
also led to a surge in cybercrime, including cyber scams. The ""419 scam"" or
Nigerian scam has been a persistent problem for decades, encompassing frauds
like advance fee scams, fake lotteries, and black money scams. Initially
prevalent through postal mail and later via fax, the scam has now transitioned
to email. This study aims to identify recent types of 419 scam emails,
particularly after the covid 19 pandemic, and explore commonly used email
subjects. Analysis of the sample 419 scam emails revealed trending scams like
lucky winner, threat of exposure, business/partnership proposals, investment,
cancer/long-term illness, fund, and compensation scams. Emerging scams included
COVID-related, cryptocurrency, marketing contact, and software development
scams. Irrespective of the scam type, scammers commonly employed email subjects
such as 'Re', 'Good day', 'Greetings', 'Dear friend', 'Confirm', 'Attention',
and 'Hello dear'. The severity of cybercrime, especially the 419 scams, cannot
be overstated, as it erodes trust, causes financial losses, and hampers
Nigeria's reputation and economic progress. Combatting cyber scams and
enhancing cybersecurity measures are crucial to protect individuals and
organizations from falling victim to these fraudulent schemes."
10,SafeAR: Towards Safer Algorithmic Recourse by Risk-Aware Policies,Machine Learning,Haochen Wu; Shubham Sharma; Sunandita Patra; Sriram Gopalakrishnan,23-August-2023,"With the growing use of machine learning (ML) models in critical domains such
as finance and healthcare, the need to offer recourse for those adversely
affected by the decisions of ML models has become more important; individuals
ought to be provided with recommendations on actions to take for improving
their situation and thus receive a favorable decision. Prior work on sequential
algorithmic recourse -- which recommends a series of changes -- focuses on
action feasibility and uses the proximity of feature changes to determine
action costs. However, the uncertainties of feature changes and the risk of
higher than average costs in recourse have not been considered. It is
undesirable if a recourse could (with some probability) result in a worse
situation from which recovery requires an extremely high cost. It is essential
to incorporate risks when computing and evaluating recourse. We call the
recourse computed with such risk considerations as Safer Algorithmic Recourse
(SafeAR). The objective is to empower people to choose a recourse based on
their risk tolerance. In this work, we discuss and show how existing recourse
desiderata can fail to capture the risk of higher costs. We present a method to
compute recourse policies that consider variability in cost and connect
algorithmic recourse literature with risk-sensitive reinforcement learning. We
also adopt measures ``Value at Risk'' and ``Conditional Value at Risk'' from
the financial literature to summarize risk concisely. We apply our method to
two real-world datasets and compare policies with different levels of
risk-aversion using risk measures and recourse desiderata (sparsity and
proximity)."
11,Particle-in-cell Simulations of the Magnetorotational Instability in Stratified Shearing Boxes,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,Astor Sandoval; Mario Riquelme; Anatoly Spitkovsky; Fabio Bacchini,23-August-2023,"The magnetorotational instability (MRI) plays a crucial role in regulating
the accretion efficiency in astrophysical accretion disks. In low-luminosity
disks around black holes, such as Sgr A* and M87, Coulomb collisions are
infrequent, making the MRI physics effectively collisionless. The collisionless
MRI gives rise to kinetic plasma effects that can potentially affect its
dynamic and thermodynamic properties. We present 2D and 3D particle-in-cell
(PIC) plasma simulations of the collisionless MRI in stratified disks using
shearing boxes with net vertical field. We use pair plasmas, with initial
$\beta=100$ and concentrate on sub-relativistic plasma temperatures ($k_BT
\lesssim mc^2$). Our 2D and 3D runs show disk expansion, particle and magnetic
field outflows, and a dynamo-like process. They also produce magnetic pressure
dominated disks with (Maxwell stress dominated) viscosity parameter $\alpha
\sim 0.5-1$. By the end of the simulations, the dynamo-like magnetic field
tends to dominate the magnetic energy and the viscosity in the disks. Our 2D
and 3D runs produce fairly similar results, and are also consistent with
previous 3D MHD simulations. Our simulations also show nonthermal particle
acceleration, approximately characterized by power-law tails with temperature
dependent spectral indices $-p$. For temperatures $k_BT \sim 0.05-0.3\, mc^2$,
we find $p\approx 2.2-1.9$. The maximum accelerated particle energy depends on
the scale separation between MHD and Larmor-scale plasma phenomena in a way
consistent with previous PIC results of magnetic reconnection-driven
acceleration. Our study constitutes a first step towards modeling from first
principles potentially observable stratified MRI effects in low-luminosity
accretion disks around black holes."
12,Learning to Learn Financial Networks for Optimising Momentum Strategies,Portfolio Management,Xingyue Pu; Stefan Zohren; Stephen Roberts; Xiaowen Dong,23-August-2023,"Network momentum provides a novel type of risk premium, which exploits the
interconnections among assets in a financial network to predict future returns.
However, the current process of constructing financial networks relies heavily
on expensive databases and financial expertise, limiting accessibility for
small-sized and academic institutions. Furthermore, the traditional approach
treats network construction and portfolio optimisation as separate tasks,
potentially hindering optimal portfolio performance. To address these
challenges, we propose L2GMOM, an end-to-end machine learning framework that
simultaneously learns financial networks and optimises trading signals for
network momentum strategies. The model of L2GMOM is a neural network with a
highly interpretable forward propagation architecture, which is derived from
algorithm unrolling. The L2GMOM is flexible and can be trained with diverse
loss functions for portfolio performance, e.g. the negative Sharpe ratio.
Backtesting on 64 continuous future contracts demonstrates a significant
improvement in portfolio profitability and risk control, with a Sharpe ratio of
1.74 across a 20-year period."
13,Rationally Correcting Impurity Levels Positions Based on Electrostatic Potential Strategy for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting,Materials Science,Dazhong Sun; Wentao Li; Anqi Shi; Wenxia Zhang; Huabing Shu; Fengfeng Chi; Bing Wang; Xiuyun Zhang; Xianghong Niu,23-August-2023,"Doping to induce suitable impurity levels is an effective strategy to achieve
highly efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting (POWS). However, to
predict the position of impurity levels, it is not enough to only depend on the
projected density of states of the substituted atom in the traditional method.
Herein, taking in phosphorus-doped g-C3N5 as a sample, we find that the
impurity atom can change electrostatic potential gradient and polarity, then
significantly affect the spatial electron density around the substituted atom,
which further adjusts the impurity level position. Based on the redox potential
requirement of POWS, we not only obtain suitable impurity levels, but also
expand the visible light absorption range. Simultaneously, the strengthened
polarity induced by doping further improve the redox ability of photogenerated
carriers. Moreover, the enhanced surface dipoles obviously promote the
adsorption and subsequent splitting of water molecules. Our study provides a
more comprehensive view to realize accurate regulation of impurity levels in
doping engineering and gives reasonable strategies for designing an excellent
catalyst of POWS."
14,Quantum-Noise-driven Generative Diffusion Models,Quantum Physics,Marco Parigi; Stefano Martina; Filippo Caruso,23-August-2023,"Generative models realized with machine learning techniques are powerful
tools to infer complex and unknown data distributions from a finite number of
training samples in order to produce new synthetic data. Diffusion models are
an emerging framework that have recently overcome the performance of the
generative adversarial networks in creating synthetic text and high-quality
images. Here, we propose and discuss the quantum generalization of diffusion
models, i.e., three quantum-noise-driven generative diffusion models that could
be experimentally tested on real quantum systems. The idea is to harness unique
quantum features, in particular the non-trivial interplay among coherence,
entanglement and noise that the currently available noisy quantum processors do
unavoidably suffer from, in order to overcome the main computational burdens of
classical diffusion models during inference. Hence, we suggest to exploit
quantum noise not as an issue to be detected and solved but instead as a very
remarkably beneficial key ingredient to generate much more complex probability
distributions that would be difficult or even impossible to express
classically, and from which a quantum processor might sample more efficiently
than a classical one. Therefore, our results are expected to pave the way for
new quantum-inspired or quantum-based generative diffusion algorithms
addressing more powerfully classical tasks as data generation/prediction with
widespread real-world applications ranging from climate forecasting to
neuroscience, from traffic flow analysis to financial forecasting."
15,Advances in the nested soft-collinear subtraction scheme,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,Chiara Signorile-Signorile; Davide Maria Tagliabue,23-August-2023,"We discuss a path toward the generalisation of the nested soft-collinear
subtraction scheme to arbitrary $2\rightarrow n$ processes. The scheme is
designed to provide an efficient and process-independent procedure to extract
and regulate infrared (IR) singularities arising from unresolved real radiation
and combine them with explicit singularities in virtual corrections. The new
approach is based on a reorganisation of the relevant subtraction terms into
simple combinations of a relatively small number of recurring structures. This
strategy leads to a drastic reduction in the computational effort required to
derive integrated subtraction terms, while preserving the full generality of
the scheme. We believe that this approach will allow for tackling the issue of
regularising IR divergences at next-to-next-to-leading order in the strong
coupling constant for arbitrary, multi-parton processes."
16,Open Questions about the Visualization of Sociodemographic Data,Human-Computer Interaction,Florent Cabric; Margrét Vilborg Bjarnadóttir; Anne-Flore Cabouat; Petra Isenberg,23-August-2023,"This paper collects a set of open research questions on how to visualize
sociodemographic data. Sociodemographic data is a common part of datasets
related to people, including institutional censuses, health data systems, and
human-resources fles. This data is sensitive, and its collection, sharing, and
analysis require careful consideration. For instance, the European Union,
through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), protects the collection
and processing of any personal data, including sexual orientation, ethnicity,
and religion. Data visualization of sociodemographic data can reinforce
stereotypes, marginalize groups, and lead to biased decision-making. It is,
therefore, critical that these visualizations are created based on good,
equitable design principles. In this paper, we discuss and provide a set of
open research questions around the visualization of sociodemographic data. Our
work contributes to an ongoing refection on representing data about people and
highlights some important future research directions for the VIS community. A
version of this paper and its fgures are available online at osf.io/a2u9c."
17,Retail Demand Forecasting: A Comparative Study for Multivariate Time Series,Machine Learning,Md Sabbirul Haque; Md Shahedul Amin; Jonayet Miah,23-August-2023,"Accurate demand forecasting in the retail industry is a critical determinant
of financial performance and supply chain efficiency. As global markets become
increasingly interconnected, businesses are turning towards advanced prediction
models to gain a competitive edge. However, existing literature mostly focuses
on historical sales data and ignores the vital influence of macroeconomic
conditions on consumer spending behavior. In this study, we bridge this gap by
enriching time series data of customer demand with macroeconomic variables,
such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS), and
unemployment rates. Leveraging this comprehensive dataset, we develop and
compare various regression and machine learning models to predict retail demand
accurately."
18,Model-free Learning with Heterogeneous Dynamical Systems: A Federated LQR Approach,Optimization and Control,Han Wang; Leonardo F. Toso; Aritra Mitra; James Anderson,22-August-2023,"We study a model-free federated linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem
where M agents with unknown, distinct yet similar dynamics collaboratively
learn an optimal policy to minimize an average quadratic cost while keeping
their data private. To exploit the similarity of the agents' dynamics, we
propose to use federated learning (FL) to allow the agents to periodically
communicate with a central server to train policies by leveraging a larger
dataset from all the agents. With this setup, we seek to understand the
following questions: (i) Is the learned common policy stabilizing for all
agents? (ii) How close is the learned common policy to each agent's own optimal
policy? (iii) Can each agent learn its own optimal policy faster by leveraging
data from all agents? To answer these questions, we propose a federated and
model-free algorithm named FedLQR. Our analysis overcomes numerous technical
challenges, such as heterogeneity in the agents' dynamics, multiple local
updates, and stability concerns. We show that FedLQR produces a common policy
that, at each iteration, is stabilizing for all agents. We provide bounds on
the distance between the common policy and each agent's local optimal policy.
Furthermore, we prove that when learning each agent's optimal policy, FedLQR
achieves a sample complexity reduction proportional to the number of agents M
in a low-heterogeneity regime, compared to the single-agent setting."
19,Knowledge Graph Prompting for Multi-Document Question Answering,Computation and Language,Yu Wang; Nedim Lipka; Ryan A. Rossi; Alexa Siu; Ruiyi Zhang; Tyler Derr,22-August-2023,"The 'pre-train, prompt, predict' paradigm of large language models (LLMs) has
achieved remarkable success in open-domain question answering (OD-QA). However,
few works explore this paradigm in the scenario of multi-document question
answering (MD-QA), a task demanding a thorough understanding of the logical
associations among the contents and structures of different documents. To fill
this crucial gap, we propose a Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) method to
formulate the right context in prompting LLMs for MD-QA, which consists of a
graph construction module and a graph traversal module. For graph construction,
we create a knowledge graph (KG) over multiple documents with nodes symbolizing
passages or document structures (e.g., pages/tables), and edges denoting the
semantic/lexical similarity between passages or intra-document structural
relations. For graph traversal, we design an LM-guided graph traverser that
navigates across nodes and gathers supporting passages assisting LLMs in MD-QA.
The constructed graph serves as the global ruler that regulates the
transitional space among passages and reduces retrieval latency. Concurrently,
the LM-guided traverser acts as a local navigator that gathers pertinent
context to progressively approach the question and guarantee retrieval quality.
Extensive experiments underscore the efficacy of KGP for MD-QA, signifying the
potential of leveraging graphs in enhancing the prompt design for LLMs. Our
code is at https://github.com/YuWVandy/KG-LLM-MDQA."
20,Decision-Making for Land Conservation: A Derivative-Free Optimization Framework with Nonlinear Inputs,Optimization and Control,Cassidy K. Buhler; Hande Y. Benson,22-August-2023,"Protected areas (PAs) are designated spaces where human activities are
restricted to preserve critical habitats. Decision-makers are challenged with
balancing a trade-off of financial feasibility with ecological benefit when
establishing PAs. Given the long-term ramifications of these decisions and the
constantly shifting environment, it is crucial that PAs are carefully selected
with long-term viability in mind.
  Using AI tools like simulation and optimization is common for designating
PAs, but current decision models are primarily linear. In this paper, we
propose a derivative-free optimization framework paired with a nonlinear
component, population viability analysis (PVA). Formulated as a mixed integer
nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, our model allows for linear and
nonlinear inputs. Connectivity, competition, crowding, and other similar
concerns are handled by the PVA software, rather than expressed as constraints
of the optimization model. In addition, we present numerical results that serve
as a proof of concept, showing our models yield PAs with similar expected risk
to that of preserving every parcel in a habitat, but at a significantly lower
cost.
  The overall goal is to promote interdisciplinary work by providing a new
mathematical programming tool for conservationists that allows for nonlinear
inputs and can be paired with existing ecological software."
21,Designing an attack-defense game: how to increase robustness of financial transaction models via a competition,Machine Learning,Alexey Zaytsev; Alex Natekin; Evgeni Vorsin; Valerii Smirnov; Georgii Smirnov; Oleg Sidorshin; Alexander Senin; Alexander Dudin; Dmitry Berestnev,22-August-2023,"Given the escalating risks of malicious attacks in the finance sector and the
consequential severe damage, a thorough understanding of adversarial strategies
and robust defense mechanisms for machine learning models is critical. The
threat becomes even more severe with the increased adoption in banks more
accurate, but potentially fragile neural networks. We aim to investigate the
current state and dynamics of adversarial attacks and defenses for neural
network models that use sequential financial data as the input.
  To achieve this goal, we have designed a competition that allows realistic
and detailed investigation of problems in modern financial transaction data.
The participants compete directly against each other, so possible attacks and
defenses are examined in close-to-real-life conditions. Our main contributions
are the analysis of the competition dynamics that answers the questions on how
important it is to conceal a model from malicious users, how long does it take
to break it, and what techniques one should use to make it more robust, and
introduction additional way to attack models or increase their robustness.
  Our analysis continues with a meta-study on the used approaches with their
power, numerical experiments, and accompanied ablations studies. We show that
the developed attacks and defenses outperform existing alternatives from the
literature while being practical in terms of execution, proving the validity of
the competition as a tool for uncovering vulnerabilities of machine learning
models and mitigating them in various domains."
22,ROSGPT_Vision: Commanding Robots Using Only Language Models' Prompts,Robotics,Bilel Benjdira; Anis Koubaa; Anas M. Ali,22-August-2023,"In this paper, we argue that the next generation of robots can be commanded
using only Language Models' prompts. Every prompt interrogates separately a
specific Robotic Modality via its Modality Language Model (MLM). A central Task
Modality mediates the whole communication to execute the robotic mission via a
Large Language Model (LLM). This paper gives this new robotic design pattern
the name of: Prompting Robotic Modalities (PRM). Moreover, this paper applies
this PRM design pattern in building a new robotic framework named
ROSGPT_Vision. ROSGPT_Vision allows the execution of a robotic task using only
two prompts: a Visual and an LLM prompt. The Visual Prompt extracts, in natural
language, the visual semantic features related to the task under consideration
(Visual Robotic Modality). Meanwhile, the LLM Prompt regulates the robotic
reaction to the visual description (Task Modality). The framework automates all
the mechanisms behind these two prompts. The framework enables the robot to
address complex real-world scenarios by processing visual data, making informed
decisions, and carrying out actions automatically. The framework comprises one
generic vision module and two independent ROS nodes. As a test application, we
used ROSGPT_Vision to develop CarMate, which monitors the driver's distraction
on the roads and makes real-time vocal notifications to the driver. We showed
how ROSGPT_Vision significantly reduced the development cost compared to
traditional methods. We demonstrated how to improve the quality of the
application by optimizing the prompting strategies, without delving into
technical details. ROSGPT_Vision is shared with the community (link:
https://github.com/bilel-bj/ROSGPT_Vision) to advance robotic research in this
direction and to build more robotic frameworks that implement the PRM design
pattern and enables controlling robots using only prompts."
23,NLP-based detection of systematic anomalies among the narratives of consumer complaints,Statistics Methodology,Peiheng Gao; Ning Sun; Xuefeng Wang; Chen Yang; Ričardas Zitikis,22-August-2023,"We develop an NLP-based procedure for detecting systematic nonmeritorious
consumer complaints, simply called systematic anomalies, among complaint
narratives. While classification algorithms are used to detect pronounced
anomalies, in the case of smaller and frequent systematic anomalies, the
algorithms may falter due to a variety of reasons, including technical ones as
well as natural limitations of human analysts. Therefore, as the next step
after classification, we convert the complaint narratives into quantitative
data, which are then analyzed using an algorithm for detecting systematic
anomalies. We illustrate the entire procedure using complaint narratives from
the Consumer Complaint Database of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau."
24,PrAIoritize: Learning to Prioritize Smart Contract Bugs and Vulnerabilities,Software Engineering,Majd Soud; Grischa Liebel; Mohammad Hamdaqa,21-August-2023,"Smart contract vulnerabilities and bugs have become a key concern for
software engineers, as they can lead to significant financial losses,
reputational damage, and legal issues. Therefore, prioritizing bug fixing for
smart contracts is critical to maintaining trust. Due to the lack of tracking
tools, prioritizing smart contract-reported bugs is done manually, which is a
tedious task, limits bug triaging, and needs specialized knowledge. Towards
this end, we propose PrAIoritize; an automated approach for predicting smart
contract bug priorities that assist software engineers in prioritizing highly
urgent bug reports. PrAIoritize consists of two main phases: 1) automatic
labeling, which involves the automatic construction of a smart contract keyword
lexicon and the automatic assignment of priority levels to unlabeled bug
reports; 2) model construction, which involves feature engineering and designs
layers of feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) and bidirectional long
short-term memory (BiLSTM) with multi-class classification to better capture
the features of the textual descriptions of bugs and predict their priority
levels. The model then is trained using smart contract bug reports collected
from two data sources: open-source software (OSS) projects available on GitHub
and NVD vulnerability database. Our evaluation demonstrates significant
improvement over state-of-the-art baselines and commonly used pre-trained
models (e.g. BERT) for similar classification tasks, with 5.75%-35.29% increase
in F-measure, precision, and recall."
25,FedDAT: An Approach for Foundation Model Finetuning in Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Federated Learning,Machine Learning,Haokun Chen; Yao Zhang; Denis Krompass; Jindong Gu; Volker Tresp,21-August-2023,"Recently, foundation models have exhibited remarkable advancements in
multi-modal learning. These models, equipped with millions (or billions) of
parameters, typically require a substantial amount of data for finetuning.
However, collecting and centralizing training data from diverse sectors becomes
challenging due to distinct privacy regulations. Federated Learning (FL)
emerges as a promising solution, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively
train neural networks without centralizing their local data. To alleviate
client computation burdens and communication overheads, previous works have
adapted Parameter-efficient Finetuning (PEFT) methods for FL. Hereby, only a
small fraction of the model parameters are optimized and communicated during
federated communications. Nevertheless, most previous works have focused on a
single modality and neglected one common phenomenon, i.e., the presence of data
heterogeneity across the clients. Therefore, in this work, we propose a
finetuning framework tailored to heterogeneous multi-modal FL, called Federated
Dual-Aadapter Teacher (FedDAT). Specifically, our approach leverages a
Dual-Adapter Teacher (DAT) to address data heterogeneity by regularizing the
client local updates and applying Mutual Knowledge Distillation (MKD) for an
efficient knowledge transfer. FedDAT is the first approach that enables an
efficient distributed finetuning of foundation models for a variety of
heterogeneous Vision-Language tasks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we
conduct extensive experiments on four multi-modality FL benchmarks with
different types of data heterogeneity, where FedDAT substantially outperforms
the existing centralized PEFT methods adapted for FL."
26,Note on scattering in asymptotically nonlocal theories,High Energy Physics - Theory,Christopher D. Carone; Mikkie R. Musser,21-August-2023,"It is possible to formulate theories with many Lee-Wick particles such that a
limit exists where the low-energy theory approaches the form of a ghost-free
nonlocal theory. Such asymptotically nonlocal quantum field theories have a
derived regulator scale that is hierarchically smaller than the lightest
Lee-Wick resonance; this has been studied previously in the case of
asymptotically nonlocal scalar theories, Abelian and non-Abelian gauge
theories, and linearized gravity. Here we consider the dependence on
center-of-mass energy of scattering cross sections in these theories. While
Lee-Wick resonances can be decoupled from the low-energy theory, scattering
amplitudes nonetheless reflect the emergent nonlocality at the scale where the
quadratic divergences are regulated. This implies observable consequences in
theories designed to address the hierarchy problem, even when the Lee-Wick
resonances are not directly accessible."

Parker; Rory Smith; Kristine Spekkens; Adam R. H. Stevens; Vicente Villanueva; Adam B. Watts,21-August-2023,"We study how environment regulates the star formation cycle of 33 Virgo
Cluster satellite galaxies on 720 parsec scales. We present the first resolved
star-forming main sequence for cluster galaxies, dividing the sample based on
their global HI properties and comparing to a control sample of field galaxies.
HI-poor cluster galaxies have reduced star formation rate (SFR) surface
densities with respect to both HI-normal cluster and field galaxies (0.5 dex),
suggesting that mechanisms regulating the global HI content are responsible for
quenching local star formation. We demonstrate that the observed quenching in
HI-poor galaxies is caused by environmental processes such as ram pressure
stripping (RPS) simultaneously reducing molecular gas surface density and star
formation efficiency (SFE), compared to regions in HI-normal systems (by 0.38
and 0.22 dex, respectively). We observe systematically elevated SFRs that are
driven by increased molecular gas surface densities at fixed stellar mass
surface density in the outskirts of early-stage RPS galaxies, while SFE remains
unchanged with respect to the field sample. We quantify how RPS and starvation
affect the star formation cycle of inner and outer galaxy discs as they are
processed by the cluster. We show both are effective quenching mechanisms with
the key difference being that RPS acts upon the galaxy outskirts while
starvation regulates the star formation cycle throughout disc, including within
the truncation radius. For both processes, the quenching is caused by a
simultaneous reduction in molecular gas surface densities and SFE at fixed
stellar mass surface density."
28,Real World Time Series Benchmark Datasets with Distribution Shifts: Global Crude Oil Price and Volatility,Machine Learning,Pranay Pasula,21-August-2023,"The scarcity of task-labeled time-series benchmarks in the financial domain
hinders progress in continual learning. Addressing this deficit would foster
innovation in this area. Therefore, we present COB, Crude Oil Benchmark
datasets. COB includes 30 years of asset prices that exhibit significant
distribution shifts and optimally generates corresponding task (i.e., regime)
labels based on these distribution shifts for the three most important crude
oils in the world. Our contributions include creating real-world benchmark
datasets by transforming asset price data into volatility proxies, fitting
models using expectation-maximization (EM), generating contextual task labels
that align with real-world events, and providing these labels as well as the
general algorithm to the public. We show that the inclusion of these task
labels universally improves performance on four continual learning algorithms,
some state-of-the-art, over multiple forecasting horizons. We hope these
benchmarks accelerate research in handling distribution shifts in real-world
data, especially due to the global importance of the assets considered. We've
made the (1) raw price data, (2) task labels generated by our approach, (3) and
code for our algorithm available at https://oilpricebenchmarks.github.io."
29,Spear and Shield: Adversarial Attacks and Defense Methods for Model-Based Link Prediction on Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs,Machine Learning,Dongjin Lee; Juho Lee; Kijung Shin,21-August-2023,"Real-world graphs are dynamic, constantly evolving with new interactions,
such as financial transactions in financial networks. Temporal Graph Neural
Networks (TGNNs) have been developed to effectively capture the evolving
patterns in dynamic graphs. While these models have demonstrated their
superiority, being widely adopted in various important fields, their
vulnerabilities against adversarial attacks remain largely unexplored. In this
paper, we propose T-SPEAR, a simple and effective adversarial attack method for
link prediction on continuous-time dynamic graphs, focusing on investigating
the vulnerabilities of TGNNs. Specifically, before the training procedure of a
victim model, which is a TGNN for link prediction, we inject edge perturbations
to the data that are unnoticeable in terms of the four constraints we propose,
and yet effective enough to cause malfunction of the victim model. Moreover, we
propose a robust training approach T-SHIELD to mitigate the impact of
adversarial attacks. By using edge filtering and enforcing temporal smoothness
to node embeddings, we enhance the robustness of the victim model. Our
experimental study shows that T-SPEAR significantly degrades the victim model's
performance on link prediction tasks, and even more, our attacks are
transferable to other TGNNs, which differ from the victim model assumed by the
attacker. Moreover, we demonstrate that T-SHIELD effectively filters out
adversarial edges and exhibits robustness against adversarial attacks,
surpassing the link prediction performance of the naive TGNN by up to 11.2%
under T-SPEAR."
30,Backdooring Textual Inversion for Concept Censorship,Cryptography and Security,Yutong Wu; Jie Zhang; Florian Kerschbaum; Tianwei Zhang,21-August-2023,"Recent years have witnessed success in AIGC (AI Generated Content). People
can make use of a pre-trained diffusion model to generate images of high
quality or freely modify existing pictures with only prompts in nature
language. More excitingly, the emerging personalization techniques make it
feasible to create specific-desired images with only a few images as
references. However, this induces severe threats if such advanced techniques
are misused by malicious users, such as spreading fake news or defaming
individual reputations. Thus, it is necessary to regulate personalization
models (i.e., concept censorship) for their development and advancement.
  In this paper, we focus on the personalization technique dubbed Textual
Inversion (TI), which is becoming prevailing for its lightweight nature and
excellent performance. TI crafts the word embedding that contains detailed
information about a specific object. Users can easily download the word
embedding from public websites like Civitai and add it to their own stable
diffusion model without fine-tuning for personalization. To achieve the concept
censorship of a TI model, we propose leveraging the backdoor technique for good
by injecting backdoors into the Textual Inversion embeddings. Briefly, we
select some sensitive words as triggers during the training of TI, which will
be censored for normal use. In the subsequent generation stage, if the triggers
are combined with personalized embeddings as final prompts, the model will
output a pre-defined target image rather than images including the desired
malicious concept.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive
experiments on Stable Diffusion, a prevailing open-sourced text-to-image model.

Therrien; Julia Thom-Levy; Feixiang Wang; Tiqiao Xiao; Mingwei Xu; Xin Yue,21-August-2023,"Ultrafast radiographic imaging and tracking (U-RadIT) use state-of-the-art
ionizing particle and light sources to experimentally study sub-nanosecond
dynamic processes in physics, chemistry, biology, geology, materials science
and other fields. These processes, fundamental to nuclear fusion energy,
advanced manufacturing, green transportation and others, often involve one mole
or more atoms, and thus are challenging to compute by using the first
principles of quantum physics or other forward models. One of the central
problems in U-RadIT is to optimize information yield through, e.g.
high-luminosity X-ray and particle sources, efficient imaging and tracking
detectors, novel methods to collect data, and large-bandwidth online and
offline data processing, regulated by the underlying physics, statistics, and
computing power. We review and highlight recent progress in: a.) Detectors; b.)
U-RadIT modalities; c.) Data and algorithms; and d.) Applications.
Hardware-centric approaches to U-RadIT optimization are constrained by detector
material properties, low signal-to-noise ratio, high cost and long development
cycles of critical hardware components such as ASICs. Interpretation of
experimental data, including comparisons with forward models, is frequently
hindered by sparse measurements, model and measurement uncertainties, and
noise. Alternatively, U-RadIT makes increasing use of data science and machine
learning algorithms, including experimental implementations of compressed
sensing. Machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches, refined by
physics and materials information, may also contribute significantly to data
interpretation, uncertainty quantification and U-RadIT optimization."
32,Who should pay for frequency-containment ancillary services? Providing incentives to shape investment during the energy transition,Systems and Control,Luis Badesa,21-August-2023,"While the operating cost of electricity grids based on thermal generation was
largely driven by the cost of fuel, as renewable penetration increases,
ancillary services represent an increasingly large proportion of the running
costs. Electric frequency is an important magnitude in highly renewable grids,
as it becomes more volatile and therefore the cost related to maintaining it
within safe bounds has significantly increased. All generators and consumers
have so far been equally responsible for covering frequency-containment
ancillary services costs, but it has become relevant to rethink this regulatory
arrangement. In this paper, we discuss the issue of cost allocation for these
services, highlighting the need to evolve towards a causation-based regulatory
framework. We argue that parties responsible for creating the need for
ancillary services should bear these costs. However, this would imply an
important change in electricity market policy, therefore it is necessary to
understand the impact on current and future investments on generation, as well
as on electricity tariffs. Here we provide a qualitative analysis of this
issue, hoping to open up a focused discussion among academics, regulators and
industry."
33,Ultrafast and Ultralight Network-Based Intelligent System for Real-time Diagnosis of Ear diseases in Any Devices,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,Yubiao Yue; Xinyu Zeng; Xiaoqiang Shi; Meiping Zhang; Haihua Liang; Fan Zhang; Yanmei Chen; Zefeng Xie; Wenrui Wu; Zhenzhang Li,21-August-2023,"Traditional ear disease diagnosis heavily depends on experienced specialists
and specialized equipment, frequently resulting in misdiagnoses, treatment
delays, and financial burdens for some patients. Utilizing deep learning models
for efficient ear disease diagnosis has proven effective and affordable.
However, existing research overlooked model inference speed and parameter size
required for deployment. To tackle these challenges, we constructed a
large-scale dataset comprising eight ear disease categories and normal ear
canal samples from two hospitals. Inspired by ShuffleNetV2, we developed
Best-EarNet, an ultrafast and ultralight network enabling real-time ear disease
diagnosis. Best-EarNet incorporates the novel Local-Global Spatial Feature
Fusion Module which can capture global and local spatial information
simultaneously and guide the network to focus on crucial regions within feature
maps at various levels, mitigating low accuracy issues. Moreover, our network
uses multiple auxiliary classification heads for efficient parameter
optimization. With 0.77M parameters, Best-EarNet achieves an average frames per
second of 80 on CPU. Employing transfer learning and five-fold cross-validation
with 22,581 images from Hospital-1, the model achieves an impressive 95.23%
accuracy. External testing on 1,652 images from Hospital-2 validates its
performance, yielding 92.14% accuracy. Compared to state-of-the-art networks,
Best-EarNet establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in practical
applications. Most importantly, we developed an intelligent diagnosis system
called Ear Keeper, which can be deployed on common electronic devices. By
manipulating a compact electronic otoscope, users can perform comprehensive
scanning and diagnosis of the ear canal using real-time video. This study
provides a novel paradigm for ear endoscopy and other medical endoscopic image
recognition applications."
34,Unveiling the Interplay between Central Bank Digital Currency and Bank Deposits,Theoretical Economics,Hanfeng Chen; Maria Elena Filippin,20-August-2023,"We extend the Real Business Cycle model in Niepelt (2022) to analyze the risk
to financial stability following the introduction of a central bank digital
currency (CBDC). CBDC competes with commercial bank deposits as households'
source of liquidity. We consider different degrees of substitutability between
payment instruments and review the equivalence result in Niepelt (2022) by
introducing a collateral constraint banks must respect when borrowing from the
central bank. When CBDC and deposits are perfect substitutes, the central bank
can offer loans to banks that render the introduction of CBDC neutral to the
real economy. We show that the optimal level of the central bank's lending rate
depends on the restrictiveness of the collateral constraint: the tighter it is,
the lower the loan rate the central bank needs to post. However, when CBDC and
deposits are imperfect substitutes, the central bank cannot make banks
indifferent to the competition from CBDC. It follows that the introduction of
CBDC has real effects on the economy."
