0,Learning Spatial Features from Audio-Visual Correspondence in Egocentric Videos,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,Sagnik Majumder; Ziad Al-Halah; Kristen Grauman,10-July-2023,"We propose a self-supervised method for learning representations based on
spatial audio-visual correspondences in egocentric videos. In particular, our
method leverages a masked auto-encoding framework to synthesize masked binaural
audio through the synergy of audio and vision, thereby learning useful spatial
relationships between the two modalities. We use our pretrained features to
tackle two downstream video tasks requiring spatial understanding in social
scenarios: active speaker detection and spatial audio denoising. We show
through extensive experiments that our features are generic enough to improve
over multiple state-of-the-art baselines on two public challenging egocentric
video datasets, EgoCom and EasyCom. Project:

1,Constraining Electromagnetic Signals from Black Holes with Hair,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,Nicole R. Crumpler,10-July-2023,"We constrain a broad class of ""hairy"" black hole models capable of directly
sourcing electromagnetic radiation during a binary black hole merger. This
signal is generic and model-independent since it is characterized by the black
hole mass ($M$) and the fraction of that mass released as radiation
($\epsilon$). For field energy densities surpassing the Schwinger limit, this
mechanism triggers pair-production to produce a gamma-ray burst. By
cross-referencing gravitational wave events with gamma-ray observations, we
place upper bounds of $\epsilon<10^{-5}-10^{-4}$ for $10-50$ $M_\odot$ black
holes depending on the black hole mass. We discuss the weak detection of a
gamma-ray burst following GW150914 and show that this event is consistent with
rapid electromagnetic emission directly from a ""hairy"" black hole with
$\epsilon\sim10^{-7}-10^{-6}$. Below the Schwinger limit, ambient charged
particles are rapidly accelerated to nearly the speed of light by the strong
electromagnetic field. For 1-50 $M_\odot$ black holes and $\epsilon$ ranging
from $10^{-20}$ to $10^{-7}$, the typical proton energies are $\sim20$ GeV-20
TeV and electron energies are $\sim0.01-10$ GeV. At these energies, cosmic ray
protons and electrons quickly diffuse into the Milky Way's background magnetic
field, making it difficult to identify a point source producing them. Overall,
constraining $\epsilon$ in this less energetic regime becomes difficult and
future constraints may need to consider specific models of ""hairy"" black holes."
2,Atmospheric muons at PeV energies in radio neutrino detectors,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,Lilly Pyras; Christian Glaser; Steffen Hallmann; Anna Nelles,10-July-2023,"Experiments seeking to detect radio emission stemming from neutrino
interactions will soon reach sensitivities that bring a detection within reach.
Since experiments like RNO-G or the future IceCube-Gen2 target more than an
order of magnitude more effective volume than existing experiments, the renewed
and detailed study of rare backgrounds is needed. In this paper, we study the
potential background from energy losses of highly energetic atmospheric muons.
Due to both limited experimental measurements and limited modeling in hadronic
interaction models, the expected event rate is subject to large uncertainties.
Here, we estimate rate predictions and their uncertainties for different models
and instrumental parameters. We also study possible routes towards mitigation,
such as parent air shower detection, and illustrate what is needed to make the
first measurement of the prompt muon flux at energies above 10 PeV."
3,"Supercooling in Radiative Symmetry Breaking: Theory Extensions, Gravitational Wave Detection and Primordial Black Holes",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,Alberto Salvio,10-July-2023,"First-order phase transitions, which take place when the symmetries are
predominantly broken (and masses are then generated) through radiative
corrections, produce observable gravitational waves and primordial black holes.
We provide a model-independent approach that is valid for large-enough
supercooling to quantitatively describe these phenomena in terms of few
parameters, which are computable once the model is specified. The validity of a
previously-proposed approach of this sort is extended here to a larger class of
theories. Among other things, we identify regions of the parameter space that
correspond to the background of gravitational waves recently detected by pulsar
timing arrays (NANOGrav, CPTA, EPTA, PPTA) and others that are either excluded
by the observing runs of LIGO and Virgo or within the reach of future
gravitational wave detectors. Furthermore, we find regions of the parameter
space where primordial black holes produced by large over-densities due to such
phase transitions can account for dark matter. Finally, it is shown how this
model-independent approach can be applied to specific cases, including a
phenomenological completion of the Standard Model with right-handed neutrinos
and gauged $B-L$ undergoing radiative symmetry breaking."
4,Spoofing-Resilient LiDAR-GPS Factor Graph Localization with Chimera Authentication,Signal Processing,Adam Dai; Tara Minda; Ashwin Kanhere; Grace Gao,10-July-2023,"Many vehicle platforms typically use sensors such as LiDAR or camera for
locally-referenced navigation with GPS for globally-referenced navigation.
However, due to the unencrypted nature of GPS signals, all civilian users are
vulner-able to spoofing attacks, where a malicious spoofer broadcasts
fabricated signals and causes the user to track a false position fix. To
protect against such GPS spoofing attacks, Chips-Message Robust Authentication
(Chimera) has been developed and will be tested on the Navigation Technology
Satellite 3 (NTS-3) satellite being launched later this year. However, Chimera
authentication is not continuously available and may not provide sufficient
protection for vehicles which rely on more frequent GPS measurements. In this
paper, we propose a factor graph-based state estimation framework which
integrates LiDAR and GPS while simultaneously detecting and mitigating spoofing
attacks experienced between consecutive Chimera authentications. Our proposed
framework combines GPS pseudorange measurements with LiDAR odometry to provide
a robust navigation solution. A chi-squared detector, based on pseudorange
residuals, is used to detect and mitigate any potential GPS spoofing attacks.
We evaluate our method using real-world LiDAR data from the KITTI dataset and
simulated GPS measurements, both nominal and with spoofing. Across multiple
trajectories and Monte Carlo runs, our method consistently achieves position
errors under 5 m during nominal conditions, and successfully bounds positioning
error to within odometry drift levels during spoofed conditions."
