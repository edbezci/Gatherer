0,The geometry of financial institutions -- Wasserstein clustering of financial data,Machine Learning,Lorenz Riess; Mathias Beiglböck; Johannes Temme; Andreas Wolf; Julio Backhoff,05-May-2023,"The increasing availability of granular and big data on various objects of
interest has made it necessary to develop methods for condensing this
information into a representative and intelligible map. Financial regulation is
a field that exemplifies this need, as regulators require diverse and often
highly granular data from financial institutions to monitor and assess their
activities. However, processing and analyzing such data can be a daunting task,
especially given the challenges of dealing with missing values and identifying
clusters based on specific features.
  To address these challenges, we propose a variant of Lloyd's algorithm that
applies to probability distributions and uses generalized Wasserstein
barycenters to construct a metric space which represents given data on various
objects in condensed form. By applying our method to the financial regulation
context, we demonstrate its usefulness in dealing with the specific challenges
faced by regulators in this domain. We believe that our approach can also be
applied more generally to other fields where large and complex data sets need
to be represented in concise form."
1,Decentralized Finance (DeFi),General Finance,Mansur Bestas,15-February-2023,"Decentralized finance, powered by blockchain technology, is growing day by
day. This field, which emerged a few years ago, today manages $70 billion in
assets. In this study, the concept of decentralized finance is discussed and
explained the differences from traditional finance. Then, compliance with the
legal regulations and the requirements to ensure compliance are mentioned. An
evaluation has been made about the financial services offered by the
decentralized finance field and the stock market and stablecoins that it uses
as a tool while providing these services. Its economic effects, security and,
privacy dimensions are examined. In the study, the differences between
centralized and decentralized finance, which generally covers legal, economic,
security, privacy, and market manipulation, are systematically analyzed. A
structured methodology is presented to distinguish between centralized and
decentralized financial services. Keywords: decentralized finance, FinTech,
financial regulation, blockchain, distributed ledger technology."
2,An Axiomatic Viewpoint on the Rogers--Veraart and Suzuki--Elsinger Models of Systemic Risk,Optimization and Control,Yuri Kabanov; Arthur Sidorenko,26-December-2022,"We study a model of clearing in an interbank network with crossholdings and
default charges. Following the Eisenberg--Noe approach, we define the model via
a set of natural financial regulations including those related with eventual
default charges and derive a finite family of fixpoint problems. These problems
are parameterized by vectors of binary variables. Our model combines features
of the Ararat--Meimanjanov, Rogers--Veraart, and Suzuki--Elsinger networks. We
develop methods of computing the maximal and minimal clearing pairs using the
mixed integer-linear programming and a Gaussian elimination algorithm."
3,Interpretable Selective Learning in Credit Risk,Computational Finance,Dangxing Chen; Weicheng Ye; Jiahui Ye,21-September-2022,"The forecasting of the credit default risk has been an important research
field for several decades. Traditionally, logistic regression has been widely
recognized as a solution due to its accuracy and interpretability. As a recent
trend, researchers tend to use more complex and advanced machine learning
methods to improve the accuracy of the prediction. Although certain non-linear
machine learning methods have better predictive power, they are often
considered to lack interpretability by financial regulators. Thus, they have
not been widely applied in credit risk assessment. We introduce a neural
network with the selective option to increase interpretability by
distinguishing whether the datasets can be explained by the linear models or
not. We find that, for most of the datasets, logistic regression will be
sufficient, with reasonable accuracy; meanwhile, for some specific data
portions, a shallow neural network model leads to much better accuracy without
significantly sacrificing the interpretability."
4,Measuring Tail Risks,Risk Management,Kan Chen; Tuoyuan Cheng,15-September-2022,"Value at risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) are common high
quantile-based risk measures adopted in financial regulations and risk
management. In this paper, we propose a tail risk measure based on the most
probable maximum size of risk events (MPMR) that can occur over a length of
time. MPMR underscores the dependence of the tail risk on the risk management
time frame. Unlike VaR and ES, MPMR does not require specifying a confidence
level. We derive the risk measure analytically for several well-known
distributions. In particular, for the case where the size of the risk event
follows a power law or Pareto distribution, we show that MPMR also scales with
the number of observations $n$ (or equivalently the length of the time
interval) by a power law, $\text{MPMR}(n) \propto n^{\eta}$, where $\eta$ is
the scaling exponent. The scale invariance allows for reasonable estimations of
long-term risks based on the extrapolation of more reliable estimations of
short-term risks. The scaling relationship also gives rise to a robust and
low-bias estimator of the tail index (TI) $\xi$ of the size distribution, $\xi
= 1/\eta$. We demonstrate the use of this risk measure for describing the tail
risks in financial markets as well as the risks associated with natural hazards
(earthquakes, tsunamis, and excessive rainfall)."
5,E-backtesting,Risk Management,Qiuqi Wang; Ruodu Wang; Johanna Ziegel,27-August-2022,"In the recent Basel Accords, the Expected Shortfall (ES) replaces the
Value-at-Risk (VaR) as the standard risk measure for market risk in the banking
sector, making it the most important risk measure in financial regulation. One
of the most challenging tasks in risk modeling practice is to backtest ES
forecasts provided by financial institutions. To design a model-free
backtesting procedure for ES, we make use of the recently developed techniques
of e-values and e-processes. Model-free e-statistics are introduced to
formulate e-processes for risk measure forecasts, and unique forms of
model-free e-statistics for VaR and ES are characterized using recent results
on identification functions. For a given model-free e-statistic, optimal ways
of constructing the e-processes are studied. The proposed method can be
naturally applied to many other risk measures and statistical quantities. We
conduct extensive simulation studies and data analysis to illustrate the
advantages of the model-free backtesting method, and compare it with the ones
in the literature."
6,Understanding Volatility Spillover Relationship Among G7 Nations And India During Covid-19,Econometrics,Avik Das; Dr. Devanjali Nandi Das,19-August-2022,"Purpose: In the context of a COVID pandemic in 2020-21, this paper attempts
to capture the interconnectedness and volatility transmission dynamics. The
nature of change in volatility spillover effects and time-varying conditional
correlation among the G7 countries and India is investigated. Methodology: To
assess the volatility spillover effects, the bivariate BEKK and t- DCC (1,1)
GARCH (1,1) models have been used. Our research shows how the dynamics of
volatility spillover between India and the G7 countries shift before and during
COVID-19. Findings: The findings reveal that the extent of volatility spillover
has altered during COVID compared to the pre-COVID environment. During this
pandemic, a sharp increase in conditional correlation indicates an increase in
systematic risk between countries. Originality: The study contributes to a
better understanding of the dynamics of volatility spillover between G7
countries and India. Asset managers and foreign corporations can use the
changing spillover dynamics to improve investment decisions and implement
effective hedging measures to protect their interests. Furthermore, this
research will assist financial regulators in assessing market risk in the
future owing to crises like as COVID-19."
7,Do financial regulators act in the public's interest? A Bayesian latent class estimation framework for assessing regulatory responses to banking crises,Statistics Applications,Padma Sharma; Trambak Banerjee,08-August-2022,"When banks fail amidst financial crises, the public criticizes regulators for
bailing out or liquidating specific banks, especially the ones that gain
attention due to their size or dominance. A comprehensive assessment of
regulators, however, requires examining all their decisions, and not just
specific ones, against the regulator's dual objective of preserving financial
stability while discouraging moral hazard. In this article, we develop a
Bayesian latent class estimation framework to assess regulators on these
competing objectives and evaluate their decisions against resolution rules
recommended by theoretical studies of bank behavior designed to contain moral
hazard incentives. The proposed estimation framework addresses the unobserved
heterogeneity underlying regulator's decisions in resolving failed banks and
provides a disciplined statistical approach for inferring if they acted in the
public interest. Our results reveal that during the crises of 1980's, the U.S.
banking regulator's resolution decisions were consistent with recommended
decision rules, while the U.S. savings and loans (S&L) regulator, which
ultimately faced insolvency in 1989 at a cost of $132 billion to the taxpayer,
had deviated from such recommendations. Timely interventions based on this
evaluation could have redressed the S&L regulator's decision structure and
prevented losses to taxpayers."
8,Exploring Financial Networks Using Quantile Regression and Granger Causality,Statistical Finance,Kara Karpman; Samriddha Lahiry; Diganta Mukherjee; Sumanta Basu,21-July-2022,"In the post-crisis era, financial regulators and policymakers are
increasingly interested in data-driven tools to measure systemic risk and to
identify systemically important firms. Granger Causality (GC) based techniques
to build networks among financial firms using time series of their stock
returns have received significant attention in recent years. Existing GC
network methods model conditional means, and do not distinguish between
connectivity in lower and upper tails of the return distribution - an aspect
crucial for systemic risk analysis. We propose statistical methods that measure
connectivity in the financial sector using system-wide tail-based analysis and
is able to distinguish between connectivity in lower and upper tails of the
return distribution. This is achieved using bivariate and multivariate GC
analysis based on regular and Lasso penalized quantile regressions, an approach
we call quantile Granger causality (QGC). By considering centrality measures of
these financial networks, we can assess the build-up of systemic risk and
identify risk propagation channels. We provide an asymptotic theory of QGC
estimators under a quantile vector autoregressive model, and show its benefit
over regular GC analysis on simulated data. We apply our method to the monthly
stock returns of large U.S. firms and demonstrate that lower tail based
networks can detect systemically risky periods in historical data with higher
accuracy than mean-based networks. In a similar analysis of large Indian banks,
we find that upper and lower tail networks convey different information and
have the potential to distinguish between periods of high connectivity that are
governed by positive vs negative news in the market."
9,Discovering material information using hierarchical Reformer model on financial regulatory filings,Statistical Finance,Francois Mercier; Makesh Narsimhan,28-March-2022,"Most applications of machine learning for finance are related to forecasting
tasks for investment decisions. Instead, we aim to promote a better
understanding of financial markets with machine learning techniques. Leveraging
the tremendous progress in deep learning models for natural language
processing, we construct a hierarchical Reformer ([15]) model capable of
processing a large document level dataset, SEDAR, from canadian financial
regulatory filings. Using this model, we show that it is possible to predict
trade volume changes using regulatory filings. We adapt the pretraining task of
HiBERT ([36]) to obtain good sentence level representations using a large
unlabelled document dataset. Finetuning the model to successfully predict trade
volume changes indicates that the model captures a view from financial markets
and processing regulatory filings is beneficial. Analyzing the attention
patterns of our model reveals that it is able to detect some indications of
material information without explicit training, which is highly relevant for
investors and also for the market surveillance mandate of financial regulators."
10,Tail Risk of Electricity Futures,Risk Management,Juan Ignacio Peña; Rosa Rodriguez; Silvia Mayoral,03-February-2022,"This paper compares the in-sample and out-of-sample performance of several
models for computing the tail risk of one-month and one-year electricity
futures contracts traded in the NordPool, French, German, and Spanish markets
in 2008-2017. As measures of tail risk, we use the one-day-ahead Value-at-Risk
(VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES). With VaR, the AR (1)-GARCH (1,1) model
with Student-t distribution is the best-performing specification with 88% cases
in which the Fisher test accepts the model, with a success rate of 94% in the
left tail and of 81% in the right tail. The model passes the test of model
adequacy in the 100% of the cases in the NordPool and German markets, but only
in the 88% and 63% of the cases in the Spanish and French markets. With ES,
this model passes the test of model adequacy in 100% of cases in all markets.
Historical Simulation and Quantile Regression-based approaches misestimate tail
risks. The right-hand tail of the returns is more difficult to model than the
left-hand tail and therefore financial regulators and the administrators of
futures markets should take these results into account when setting additional
regulatory capital requirements and margin account regulations to short
positions."
11,Macroeconomic and financial management in an uncertain world: What can we learn from complexity science?,General Economics,Thitithep Sitthiyot,31-December-2021,"This paper discusses serious drawbacks of existing knowledge in
macroeconomics and finance in explaining and predicting economic and financial
phenomena. Complexity science is proposed as an alternative approach to be used
in order to better understand how economy and financial market work. This paper
argues that understanding characteristics of complex system could greatly
benefit financial analysts, financial regulators, as well as macroeconomic
policy makers."
12,An AI-based Approach for Tracing Content Requirements in Financial Documents,Information Retrieval,Xiaochen Li; Domenico Bianculli; Lionel C. Briand,28-October-2021,"The completeness (in terms of content) of financial documents is a
fundamental requirement for investment funds. To ensure completeness, financial
regulators spend a huge amount of time for carefully checking every financial
document based on the relevant content requirements, which prescribe the
information types to be included in financial documents (e.g., the description
of shares' issue conditions). Although several techniques have been proposed to
automatically detect certain types of information in documents in various
application domains, they provide limited support to help regulators
automatically identify the text chunks related to financial information types,
due to the complexity of financial documents and the diversity of the sentences
characterizing an information type. In this paper, we propose FITI, an
artificial intelligence (AI)-based method for tracing content requirements in
financial documents. Given a new financial document, FITI selects a set of
candidate sentences for efficient information type identification. Then, FITI
uses a combination of rule-based and data-centric approaches, by leveraging
information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (ML) techniques that analyze
the words, sentences, and contexts related to an information type, to rank
candidate sentences. Finally, using a list of indicator phrases related to each
information type, a heuristic-based selector, which considers both the sentence
ranking and the domain-specific phrases, determines a list of sentences
corresponding to each information type. We evaluated FITI by assessing its
effectiveness in tracing financial content requirements in 100 financial
documents. Experimental results show that FITI provides accurate identification
with average precision and recall values of 0.824 and 0.646, respectively.
Furthermore, FITI can detect about 80% of missing information types in
financial documents."
13,Heterogenous criticality in high frequency finance: a phase transition in flash crashes,Trading and Market Microstructure,Jeremy Turiel; Tomaso Aste,26-October-2021,"Flash crashes in financial markets have become increasingly important
attracting attention from financial regulators, market makers as well as from
the media and the broader audience. Systemic risk and propagation of shocks in
financial markets is also a topic of great relevance that attracted increasing
attention in recent years. In the present work we bridge the gap between these
two topics with an in-depth investigation of the systemic risk structure of
co-crashes in high frequency trading. We find that large co-crashes are
systemic in their nature and differ from small crashes. We demonstrate that
there is a phase transition between co-crashes of small and large sizes, where
the former involves mostly illiquid stocks while large and liquid stocks are
the most represented and central in the latter. This suggests that systemic
effects and shock propagation might be triggered by simultaneous withdrawals or
movement of liquidity by HFTs, arbitrageurs and market makers with cross-asset
exposures."
14,Unpacking the Black Box: Regulating Algorithmic Decisions,General Economics,Laura Blattner; Scott Nelson; Jann Spiess,05-October-2021,"We show how to optimally regulate prediction algorithms in a world where an
agent uses complex 'black-box' prediction functions to make decisions such as
lending, medical testing, or hiring, and where a principal is limited in how
much she can learn about the agent's black-box model. We show that limiting
agents to prediction functions that are simple enough to be fully transparent
is inefficient as long as the misalignment is limited and first-best prediction
functions are sufficiently complex. Algorithmic audits can improve welfare, but
the gains depend on the design of the audit tools. Tools that focus on
minimizing overall information loss, the focus of many explainer tools, will
generally be inefficient since they focus on explaining the average behavior of
the prediction function. Targeted tools that focus on the source of incentive
misalignment, e.g., excess false positives or racial disparities, can provide
second-best solutions. We provide empirical support for our theoretical
findings using an application in consumer lending, where we document that
complex models regulated based on context-specific explanation tools outperform
simple, fully transparent models. This gain from complex models represents a
Pareto improvement across our empirical applications that are preferred both by
the lender and from the perspective of the financial regulator."
15,Issuing Green Bonds on the Algorand Blockchain,Cryptography and Security,Gidon Katten,23-August-2021,"Green bonds have been shown to be effective tool for sustainability however
market growth is impeded by high issuance and transaction costs. The lack of
appropriate standardisation and frameworks raise fear of greenwashing.
  In this paper, we propose a platform for green bond issuance on the Algorand
blockchain. It offers ""Green Bonds as a Service"", increasing accessibility
through automation. The solution has minimal associated costs and supports
fractional asset ownership, both of which will help adoption especially in
developing countries. A financial regulator must preapprove an investor and can
freeze assets in the case of financial irregularities. Green bonds can be
bought directly from an issuer or in the secondary market. We also introduce a
novel mechanism whereby an issuer can upload proof of impact reports. A green
verifier uses these to submit a green rating; poor green ratings result in
reputational damage and economic penalties."
16,A Survey of Estimation Methods for Sparse High-dimensional Time Series Models,Statistics Methodology,Sumanta Basu; David S. Matteson,30-July-2021,"High-dimensional time series datasets are becoming increasingly common in
many areas of biological and social sciences. Some important applications
include gene regulatory network reconstruction using time course gene
expression data, brain connectivity analysis from neuroimaging data, structural
analysis of a large panel of macroeconomic indicators, and studying linkages
among financial firms for more robust financial regulation. These applications
have led to renewed interest in developing principled statistical methods and
theory for estimating large time series models given only a relatively small
number of temporally dependent samples. Sparse modeling approaches have gained
popularity over the last two decades in statistics and machine learning for
their interpretability and predictive accuracy. Although there is a rich
literature on several sparsity inducing methods when samples are independent,
research on the statistical properties of these methods for estimating time
series models is still in progress.
  We survey some recent advances in this area, focusing on empirically
successful lasso based estimation methods for two canonical multivariate time
series models - stochastic regression and vector autoregression. We discuss key
technical challenges arising in high-dimensional time series analysis and
outline several interesting research directions."
17,Capital Requirements and Claims Recovery: A New Perspective on Solvency Regulation,Risk Management,Cosimo Munari; Lutz Wilhelmy; Stefan Weber,22-July-2021,"Protection of creditors is a key objective of financial regulation. Where the
protection needs are high, i.e., in banking and insurance, regulatory solvency
requirements are an instrument to prevent that creditors incur losses on their
claims. The current regulatory requirements based on Value at Risk and Average
Value at Risk limit the probability of default of financial institutions, but
they fail to control the size of recovery on creditors' claims in the case of
default. We resolve this failure by developing a novel risk measure, Recovery
Value at Risk. Our conceptual approach can flexibly be extended and allows the
construction of general recovery risk measures for various risk management
purposes. By design, these risk measures control recovery on creditors' claims
and integrate the protection needs of creditors into the incentive structure of
the management. We provide detailed case studies and applications: We analyze
how recovery risk measures react to the joint distributions of assets and
liabilities on firms' balance sheets and compare the corresponding capital
requirements with the current regulatory benchmarks based on Value at Risk and
Average Value at Risk. We discuss how to calibrate recovery risk measures to
historic regulatory standards. Finally, we show that recovery risk measures can
be applied to performance-based management of business divisions of firms and
that they allow for a tractable characterization of optimal tradeoffs between
risk and return in the context of investment management."
18,Regshock: Interactive Visual Analytics of Systemic Risk in Financial Networks,Human-Computer Interaction,Zhibin Niu; Junqi Wu; Dawei Cheng; Jiawan Zhang,24-April-2021,"Financial regulatory agencies are struggling to manage the systemic risks
attributed to negative economic shocks. Preventive interventions are prominent
to eliminate the risks and help to build a more resilient financial system.
Although tremendous efforts have been made to measure multi-risk severity
levels, understand the contagion behaviors and other risk management problems,
there still lacks a theoretical framework revealing what and how regulatory
intervention measurements can mitigate systemic risk. Here we demonstrate
regshock, a practical visual analytical approach to support the exploration and
evaluation of financial regulation measurements. We propose risk-island, an
unprecedented risk-centered visualization algorithm to help uncover the risk
patterns while preserving the topology of financial networks. We further
propose regshock, a novel visual exploration and assessment approach based on
the simulation-intervention-evaluation analysis loop, to provide a heuristic
surgical intervention capability for systemic risk mitigation. We evaluate our
approach through extensive case studies and expert reviews. To our knowledge,
this is the first practical systemic method for the financial network
intervention and risk mitigation problem; our validated approach potentially
improves the risk management and control capabilities of financial experts."
19,Next Generation Models for Portfolio Risk Management: An Approach Using Financial Big Data,Risk Management,Kwangmin Jung; Donggyu Kim; Seunghyeon Yu,25-February-2021,"This paper proposes a dynamic process of portfolio risk measurement to
address potential information loss. The proposed model takes advantage of
financial big data to incorporate out-of-target-portfolio information that may
be missed when one considers the Value at Risk (VaR) measures only from certain
assets of the portfolio. We investigate how the curse of dimensionality can be
overcome in the use of financial big data and discuss where and when benefits
occur from a large number of assets. In this regard, the proposed approach is
the first to suggest the use of financial big data to improve the accuracy of
risk analysis. We compare the proposed model with benchmark approaches and
empirically show that the use of financial big data improves small portfolio
risk analysis. Our findings are useful for portfolio managers and financial
regulators, who may seek for an innovation to improve the accuracy of portfolio
risk estimation."
20,Lissy: Experimenting with on-chain order books,Cryptography and Security,Mahsa Moosavi; Jeremy Clark,15-January-2021,"Financial regulators have long-standing concerns about fully decentralized
exchanges that run 'on-chain' without any obvious regulatory hooks. The
popularity of Uniswap, an automated market makers (AMM), made these concerns a
reality. AMMs implement a lightweight dealer-based trading system, but they are
unlike anything on Wall Street, require fees intrinsically, and are susceptible
to front-running attacks. This leaves the following research questions we
address in this paper: (1) are conventional (i.e., order books), secure (i.e.,
resistant to front-running and price manipulation) and fully decentralized
exchanges feasible on a public blockchain like Ethereum, (2) what is the
performance profile, and (3) how much do Layer 2 techniques (e.g., Arbitrum)
increase performance? To answer these questions, we implement, benchmark, and
experiment with an Ethereum-based call market exchange called Lissy. We confirm
the functionality is too heavy for Ethereum today (you cannot expect to exceed
a few hundred trade executions per block) but show it scales dramatically
(99.88% gas cost reduction) on Arbitrum."
21,Evaluating structural edge importance in temporal networks,"Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science",Isobel Seabrook; Paolo Barucca; Fabio Caccioli,23-December-2020,"To monitor risk in temporal financial networks, we need to understand how
individual behaviours affect the global evolution of networks. Here we define a
structural importance metric - which we denote as $l_e$ - for the edges of a
network. The metric is based on perturbing the adjacency matrix and observing
the resultant change in its largest eigenvalues. We then propose a model of
network evolution where this metric controls the probabilities of subsequent
edge changes. We show using synthetic data how the parameters of the model are
related to the capability of predicting whether an edge will change from its
value of $l_e$. We then estimate the model parameters associated with five real
financial and social networks, and we study their predictability. These methods
have application in financial regulation whereby it is important to understand
how individual changes to financial networks will impact their global
behaviour. It also provides fundamental insights into spectral predictability
in networks, and it demonstrates how spectral perturbations can be a useful
tool in understanding the interplay between micro and macro features of
networks."
22,Pattern recognition in micro-trading behaviors before stock price jumps: A framework based on multivariate time series analysis,Statistical Finance,Ao Kong; Robert Azencott; Hongliang Zhu; Xindan Li,10-November-2020,"Studying the micro-trading behaviors before stock price jumps is an important
problem for financial regulations and investment decisions. In this study, we
provide a new framework to study pre-jump trading behaviors based on
multivariate time series analysis. Different from the existing literature, our
methodology takes into account the temporal information embedded in the
trading-related attributes and can better evaluate and compare the abnormality
levels of different attributes. Moreover, it can explore the joint
informativeness of the attributes as well as select a subset of highly
informative but minimally redundant attributes to analyze the homogeneous and
idiosyncratic patterns in the pre-jump trades of individual stocks. In
addition, our analysis involves a set of technical indicators to describe
micro-trading behaviors. To illustrate the viability of the proposed
methodology, an application case is conducted based on the level-2 data of 189
constituent stocks of the China Security Index 300. The individual and joint
informativeness levels of the attributes in predicting price jumps are
evaluated and compared. To this end, our experiment provides a set of jump
indicators that can represent the pre-jump trading behaviors in the Chinese
stock market and have detected some stocks with extremely abnormal pre-jump
trades."
23,Railgun: streaming windows for mission critical systems,"Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing",João Oliveirinha; Ana Sofia Gomes; Pedro Cardoso; Pedro Bizarro,01-September-2020,"Some mission critical systems, such as fraud detection, require accurate,
real-time metrics over long time windows on applications that demand high
throughputs and low latencies. As these applications need to run ""forever"",
cope with large and spiky data loads, they further require to be run in a
distributed setting. Unsurprisingly, we are unaware of any distributed
streaming system that provides all those properties. Instead, existing systems
take large simplifications, such as implementing sliding windows as a fixed set
of partially overlapping windows, jeopardizing metric accuracy (violating
financial regulator rules) or latency (breaching service agreements).
  In this paper, we propose Railgun, a fault-tolerant, elastic, and distributed
streaming system supporting real-time sliding windows for scenarios requiring
high loads and millisecond-level latencies. We benchmarked an initial prototype
of Railgun using real data, showing significant lower latency than Flink, and
low memory usage, independent of window size."
24,regvis.net -- A Visual Bibliography of Regulatory Visualization,Computers and Society,Zhibin Niu; Runlin Li; Junqi Wu; Yaqi Xue; Jiawan Zhang,07-July-2020,"Information visualization and visual analytics technology has attracted
significant attention from the financial regulation community. In this
research, we present regvis.net, a visual survey of regulatory visualization
that allows researchers from both the computing and financial communities to
review their literature of interest. We have collected and manually tagged more
than 80 regulation visualization related publications. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first publication set tailored for regulatory
visualization. We have provided a webpage (http://regvis.net) for interactive
searches and filtering. Each publication is represented by a thumbnail of the
representative system interface or key visualization chart, and users can
conduct multi-condition screening explorations and fixed text searches."
25,Learning a functional control for high-frequency finance,Optimization and Control,Laura Leal; Mathieu Laurière; Charles-Albert Lehalle,17-June-2020,"We use a deep neural network to generate controllers for optimal trading on
high frequency data. For the first time, a neural network learns the mapping
between the preferences of the trader, i.e. risk aversion parameters, and the
optimal controls. An important challenge in learning this mapping is that in
intraday trading, trader's actions influence price dynamics in closed loop via
the market impact. The exploration--exploitation tradeoff generated by the
efficient execution is addressed by tuning the trader's preferences to ensure
long enough trajectories are produced during the learning phase. The issue of
scarcity of financial data is solved by transfer learning: the neural network
is first trained on trajectories generated thanks to a Monte-Carlo scheme,
leading to a good initialization before training on historical trajectories.
Moreover, to answer to genuine requests of financial regulators on the
explainability of machine learning generated controls, we project the obtained
""blackbox controls"" on the space usually spanned by the closed-form solution of
the stylized optimal trading problem, leading to a transparent structure. For
more realistic loss functions that have no closed-form solution, we show that
the average distance between the generated controls and their explainable
version remains small. This opens the door to the acceptance of ML-generated
controls by financial regulators."
26,Interpretable Multimodal Learning for Intelligent Regulation in Online Payment Systems,Systems and Control,Shuoyao Wang; Diwei Zhu,10-June-2020,"With the explosive growth of transaction activities in online payment
systems, effective and realtime regulation becomes a critical problem for
payment service providers. Thanks to the rapid development of artificial
intelligence (AI), AI-enable regulation emerges as a promising solution. One
main challenge of the AI-enabled regulation is how to utilize multimedia
information, i.e., multimodal signals, in Financial Technology (FinTech).
Inspired by the attention mechanism in nature language processing, we propose a
novel cross-modal and intra-modal attention network (CIAN) to investigate the
relation between the text and transaction. More specifically, we integrate the
text and transaction information to enhance the text-trade jointembedding
learning, which clusters positive pairs and push negative pairs away from each
other. Another challenge of intelligent regulation is the interpretability of
complicated machine learning models. To sustain the requirements of financial
regulation, we design a CIAN-Explainer to interpret how the attention mechanism
interacts the original features, which is formulated as a low-rank matrix
approximation problem. With the real datasets from the largest online payment
system, WeChat Pay of Tencent, we conduct experiments to validate the practical
application value of CIAN, where our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods."
27,Know Your Clients' behaviours: a cluster analysis of financial transactions,Econometrics,John R. J. Thompson; Longlong Feng; R. Mark Reesor; Chuck Grace,07-May-2020,"In Canada, financial advisors and dealers are required by provincial
securities commissions and self-regulatory organizations--charged with direct
regulation over investment dealers and mutual fund dealers--to respectively
collect and maintain Know Your Client (KYC) information, such as their age or
risk tolerance, for investor accounts. With this information, investors, under
their advisor's guidance, make decisions on their investments which are
presumed to be beneficial to their investment goals. Our unique dataset is
provided by a financial investment dealer with over 50,000 accounts for over
23,000 clients. We use a modified behavioural finance recency, frequency,
monetary model for engineering features that quantify investor behaviours, and
machine learning clustering algorithms to find groups of investors that behave
similarly. We show that the KYC information collected does not explain client
behaviours, whereas trade and transaction frequency and volume are most
informative. We believe the results shown herein encourage financial regulators
and advisors to use more advanced metrics to better understand and predict
investor behaviours."
28,XtracTree: a Simple and Effective Method for Regulator Validation of Bagging Methods Used in Retail Banking,Machine Learning,Jeremy Charlier; Vladimir Makarenkov,05-April-2020,"Bootstrap aggregation, known as bagging, is one of the most popular ensemble
methods used in machine learning (ML). An ensemble method is a ML method that
combines multiple hypotheses to form a single hypothesis used for prediction. A
bagging algorithm combines multiple classifiers modeled on different
sub-samples of the same data set to build one large classifier. Banks, and
their retail banking activities, are nowadays using the power of ML algorithms,
including decision trees and random forests, to optimize their processes.
However, banks have to comply with regulators and governance and, hence,
delivering effective ML solutions is a challenging task. It starts with the
bank's validation and governance department, followed by the deployment of the
solution in a production environment up to the external validation of the
national financial regulator. Each proposed ML model has to be validated and
clear rules for every algorithm-based decision must be justified. In this
context, we propose XtracTree, an algorithm capable of efficiently converting
an ML bagging classifier, such as a random forest, into simple ""if-then"" rules
satisfying the requirements of model validation. We use a public loan data set
from Kaggle to illustrate the usefulness of our approach. Our experiments
demonstrate that using XtracTree, one can convert an ML model into a rule-based
algorithm, leading to easier model validation by national financial regulators
and the bank's validation department. The proposed approach allowed our banking
institution to reduce up to 50% the time of delivery of our AI solutions to the
end-user."
29,Default Ambiguity: Finding the Best Solution to the Clearing Problem,"Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science",Pál András Papp; Roger Wattenhofer,18-February-2020,"We study financial networks with debt contracts and credit default swaps
between specific pairs of banks. Given such a financial system, we want to
decide which of the banks are in default, and how much of their liabilities can
these defaulting banks pay. There can easily be multiple different solutions to
this problem, leading to a situation of default ambiguity, and a range of
possible solutions to implement for a financial authority.
  In this paper, we study the properties of the solution space of such
financial systems, and analyze a wide range of reasonable objective functions
for selecting from the set of solutions. Examples of such objective functions
include minimizing the number of defaulting banks, minimizing the amount of
unpaid debt, maximizing the number of satisfied banks, and many others. We show
that for all of these objectives, it is NP-hard to approximate the optimal
solution to an $n^{1-\epsilon}$ factor for any $\epsilon>0$, with $n$ denoting
the number of banks. Furthermore, we show that this situation is rather
difficult to avoid from a financial regulator's perspective: the same hardness
results also hold if we apply strong restrictions on the weights of the debts,
the structure of the network, or the amount of funds that banks must possess.
However, if we restrict both the network structure and the amount of funds
simultaneously, then the solution becomes unique, and it can be found
efficiently."
