0,Learning Spatial Features from Audio-Visual Correspondence in Egocentric Videos,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,Sagnik Majumder; Ziad Al-Halah; Kristen Grauman,10-July-2023,"We propose a self-supervised method for learning representations based on
spatial audio-visual correspondences in egocentric videos. In particular, our
method leverages a masked auto-encoding framework to synthesize masked binaural
audio through the synergy of audio and vision, thereby learning useful spatial
relationships between the two modalities. We use our pretrained features to
tackle two downstream video tasks requiring spatial understanding in social
scenarios: active speaker detection and spatial audio denoising. We show
through extensive experiments that our features are generic enough to improve
over multiple state-of-the-art baselines on two public challenging egocentric
video datasets, EgoCom and EasyCom. Project:

1,Constraining Electromagnetic Signals from Black Holes with Hair,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,Nicole R. Crumpler,10-July-2023,"We constrain a broad class of ""hairy"" black hole models capable of directly
sourcing electromagnetic radiation during a binary black hole merger. This
signal is generic and model-independent since it is characterized by the black
hole mass ($M$) and the fraction of that mass released as radiation
($\epsilon$). For field energy densities surpassing the Schwinger limit, this
mechanism triggers pair-production to produce a gamma-ray burst. By
cross-referencing gravitational wave events with gamma-ray observations, we
place upper bounds of $\epsilon<10^{-5}-10^{-4}$ for $10-50$ $M_\odot$ black
holes depending on the black hole mass. We discuss the weak detection of a
gamma-ray burst following GW150914 and show that this event is consistent with
rapid electromagnetic emission directly from a ""hairy"" black hole with
$\epsilon\sim10^{-7}-10^{-6}$. Below the Schwinger limit, ambient charged
particles are rapidly accelerated to nearly the speed of light by the strong
electromagnetic field. For 1-50 $M_\odot$ black holes and $\epsilon$ ranging
from $10^{-20}$ to $10^{-7}$, the typical proton energies are $\sim20$ GeV-20
TeV and electron energies are $\sim0.01-10$ GeV. At these energies, cosmic ray
protons and electrons quickly diffuse into the Milky Way's background magnetic
field, making it difficult to identify a point source producing them. Overall,
constraining $\epsilon$ in this less energetic regime becomes difficult and
future constraints may need to consider specific models of ""hairy"" black holes."
2,Atmospheric muons at PeV energies in radio neutrino detectors,High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,Lilly Pyras; Christian Glaser; Steffen Hallmann; Anna Nelles,10-July-2023,"Experiments seeking to detect radio emission stemming from neutrino
interactions will soon reach sensitivities that bring a detection within reach.
Since experiments like RNO-G or the future IceCube-Gen2 target more than an
order of magnitude more effective volume than existing experiments, the renewed
and detailed study of rare backgrounds is needed. In this paper, we study the
potential background from energy losses of highly energetic atmospheric muons.
Due to both limited experimental measurements and limited modeling in hadronic
interaction models, the expected event rate is subject to large uncertainties.
Here, we estimate rate predictions and their uncertainties for different models
and instrumental parameters. We also study possible routes towards mitigation,
such as parent air shower detection, and illustrate what is needed to make the
first measurement of the prompt muon flux at energies above 10 PeV."
3,"Supercooling in Radiative Symmetry Breaking: Theory Extensions, Gravitational Wave Detection and Primordial Black Holes",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,Alberto Salvio,10-July-2023,"First-order phase transitions, which take place when the symmetries are
predominantly broken (and masses are then generated) through radiative
corrections, produce observable gravitational waves and primordial black holes.
We provide a model-independent approach that is valid for large-enough
supercooling to quantitatively describe these phenomena in terms of few
parameters, which are computable once the model is specified. The validity of a
previously-proposed approach of this sort is extended here to a larger class of
theories. Among other things, we identify regions of the parameter space that
correspond to the background of gravitational waves recently detected by pulsar
timing arrays (NANOGrav, CPTA, EPTA, PPTA) and others that are either excluded
by the observing runs of LIGO and Virgo or within the reach of future
gravitational wave detectors. Furthermore, we find regions of the parameter
space where primordial black holes produced by large over-densities due to such
phase transitions can account for dark matter. Finally, it is shown how this
model-independent approach can be applied to specific cases, including a
phenomenological completion of the Standard Model with right-handed neutrinos
and gauged $B-L$ undergoing radiative symmetry breaking."
4,Spoofing-Resilient LiDAR-GPS Factor Graph Localization with Chimera Authentication,Signal Processing,Adam Dai; Tara Minda; Ashwin Kanhere; Grace Gao,10-July-2023,"Many vehicle platforms typically use sensors such as LiDAR or camera for
locally-referenced navigation with GPS for globally-referenced navigation.
However, due to the unencrypted nature of GPS signals, all civilian users are
vulner-able to spoofing attacks, where a malicious spoofer broadcasts
fabricated signals and causes the user to track a false position fix. To
protect against such GPS spoofing attacks, Chips-Message Robust Authentication
(Chimera) has been developed and will be tested on the Navigation Technology
Satellite 3 (NTS-3) satellite being launched later this year. However, Chimera
authentication is not continuously available and may not provide sufficient
protection for vehicles which rely on more frequent GPS measurements. In this
paper, we propose a factor graph-based state estimation framework which
integrates LiDAR and GPS while simultaneously detecting and mitigating spoofing
attacks experienced between consecutive Chimera authentications. Our proposed
framework combines GPS pseudorange measurements with LiDAR odometry to provide
a robust navigation solution. A chi-squared detector, based on pseudorange
residuals, is used to detect and mitigate any potential GPS spoofing attacks.
We evaluate our method using real-world LiDAR data from the KITTI dataset and
simulated GPS measurements, both nominal and with spoofing. Across multiple
trajectories and Monte Carlo runs, our method consistently achieves position
errors under 5 m during nominal conditions, and successfully bounds positioning
error to within odometry drift levels during spoofed conditions."
5,Baryogenesis and Dark Matter in the Mirror Twin Higgs,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,Pedro Bittar; Gustavo Burdman; Larissa Kiriliuk,10-July-2023,"We consider a natural asymmetric dark matter (ADM) model in the mirror twin
Higgs (MTH). We show that it is possible to obtain the correct dark matter (DM)
abundance when a twin baryon is the DM without the need of explicit breaking of
the MTH $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in the dimensionless couplings (i.e. without
hard $\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking). We illustrate how this is possible in a specific
baryogenesis setup, which also leads to ADM. In the simplest scenario we obtain
$m_{\rm DM}\sim O(1)$~GeV, just above the proton mass. We show estimates for
direct detection rates at present and future experiments."
6,Joint Salient Object Detection and Camouflaged Object Detection via Uncertainty-aware Learning,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,Aixuan Li; Jing Zhang; Yunqiu Lv; Tong Zhang; Yiran Zhong; Mingyi He; Yuchao Dai,10-July-2023,"Salient objects attract human attention and usually stand out clearly from
their surroundings. In contrast, camouflaged objects share similar colors or
textures with the environment. In this case, salient objects are typically
non-camouflaged, and camouflaged objects are usually not salient. Due to this
inherent contradictory attribute, we introduce an uncertainty-aware learning
pipeline to extensively explore the contradictory information of salient object
detection (SOD) and camouflaged object detection (COD) via data-level and
task-wise contradiction modeling. We first exploit the dataset correlation of
these two tasks and claim that the easy samples in the COD dataset can serve as
hard samples for SOD to improve the robustness of the SOD model. Based on the
assumption that these two models should lead to activation maps highlighting
different regions of the same input image, we further introduce a contrastive
module with a joint-task contrastive learning framework to explicitly model the
contradictory attributes of these two tasks. Different from conventional
intra-task contrastive learning for unsupervised representation learning, our
contrastive module is designed to model the task-wise correlation, leading to
cross-task representation learning. To better understand the two tasks from the
perspective of uncertainty, we extensively investigate the uncertainty
estimation techniques for modeling the main uncertainties of the two tasks,
namely task uncertainty (for SOD) and data uncertainty (for COD), and aiming to
effectively estimate the challenging regions for each task to achieve
difficulty-aware learning. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our solution leads to both state-of-the-art performance and
informative uncertainty estimation."
7,A note on the induction of comonotonic additive risk measures from acceptance sets,Mathematical Finance,Samuel Solgon Santos; Marlon Ruoso Moresco; Marcelo Brutti Righi; Eduardo de Oliveira Horta,10-July-2023,"We present simple general conditions on the acceptance sets under which their
induced monetary risk and deviation measures are comonotonic additive. We show
that acceptance sets induce comonotonic additive risk measures if and only if
the acceptance sets and their complements are stable under convex combinations
of comonotonic random variables. A generalization of this result applies to
risk measures that are additive for random variables with \textit{a priori}
specified dependence structures, e.g., perfectly correlated, uncorrelated, or
independent random variables."
8,Toward optimal placement of spatial sensors,Robotics,Mingyu Kim; Harun Yetkin; Daniel J. Stilwell; Jorge Jimenez; Saurav Shrestha; Nina Stark,10-July-2023,"This paper addresses the challenges of optimally placing a finite number of
sensors to detect Poisson-distributed targets in a bounded domain. We seek to
rigorously account for uncertainty in the target arrival model throughout the
problem. Sensor locations are selected to maximize the probability that no
targets are missed. While this objective function is well-suited to
applications where failure to detect targets is highly undesirable, it does not
lead to a computationally efficient optimization problem. We propose an
approximation of the objective function that is non-negative, submodular, and
monotone and for which greedy selection of sensor locations works well. We also
characterize the gap between the desired objective function and our
approximation. For numerical illustrations, we consider the case of the
detection of ship traffic using sensors mounted on the seafloor."
9,Vibroacoustic simulations of acoustic damping materials using a fictitious domain approach,Numerical Analysis,Lars Radtke; Paul Marter; Fabian Duvigneau; Sascha Eisenträger; Daniel Juhre; Alexander Düster,10-July-2023,"The numerical investigation of acoustic damping materials, such as foams,
constitutes a valuable enhancement to experimental testing. Typically, such
materials are modeled in a homogenized way in order to reduce the computational
effort and to circumvent the need for a computational mesh that resolves the
complex micro-structure. However, to gain detailed insight into the acoustic
behavior, e.g., the transmittance of noise, such fully resolved models are
mandatory. The meshing process can still be avoided by using a ficticious
domain approach. We propose the finite cell method, which combines the
ficticious domain approach with high-order finite elements and resolves the
complex geometry using special quadrature rules. In order to take into account
the fluid-filled pores of a typical damping material, a coupled vibroacoustic
problem needs to be solved. To this end, we construct two separate finite cell
discretizations and prescribe coupling conditions at the interface in the usual
manner. The only difference to a classical boundary fitted approach to
vibroacoustics is that the fluid-solid interface is immersed into the
respective discretization and does not correspond to the element boundaries.
The proposed enhancement of the finite cell method for vibroacoustics is
verified based on a comparison with commercial software and used within an
exemplary application."
