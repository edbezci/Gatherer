0,Towards Sustainable Development: A Novel Integrated Machine Learning Model for Holistic Environmental Health Monitoring,Machine Learning,Anirudh Mazumder; Sarthak Engala; Aditya Nallaparaju,20-August-2023,"Urbanization enables economic growth but also harms the environment through
degradation. Traditional methods of detecting environmental issues have proven
inefficient. Machine learning has emerged as a promising tool for tracking
environmental deterioration by identifying key predictive features. Recent
research focused on developing a predictive model using pollutant levels and
particulate matter as indicators of environmental state in order to outline
challenges. Machine learning was employed to identify patterns linking areas
with worse conditions. This research aims to assist governments in identifying
intervention points, improving planning and conservation efforts, and
ultimately contributing to sustainable development."
1,Understanding the Vegetable Oil Debate and Its Implications for Sustainability through Social Media,Physics and Society,Elena Candellone; Alberto Aleta; Henrique Ferraz de Arruda; Erik Meijaard; Yamir Moreno,14-August-2023,"The global production and consumption of vegetable oils have sparked several
discussions on sustainable development. This study analyzes over 20 million
tweets related to vegetable oils to explore the key factors shaping public
opinion. We found that coconut, olive, and palm oils dominate social media
discourse despite their lower contribution to overall global vegetable
production. The discussion about olive and palm oils remarkably correlates with
Twitter's growth, while coconut increases more significantly with bursts of
activity. Discussions around coconut and olive oils primarily focus on health,
beauty, and food, while palm draws attention to pressing environmental
concerns. Overall, virality is related to environmental issues and negative
connotations. In the context of Sustainable Development Goals, this study
highlights the multifaceted nature of the vegetable oil debate and its
disconnection from scientific discussions. Our research sheds light on the
power of social media in shaping public perception, providing insights into
sustainable development strategies."
2,Alternative Agriculture Land-Use Transformation Pathways by Partial-Equilibrium Agricultural Sector Model: A Mathematical Approach,Physics and Society,Malvika Kanojia; Prerna Kamani; Gautam Siddharth Kashyap; Shafaq Naz; Samar Wazir; Abhishek Chauhan,12-August-2023,"Humanity's progress in combating hunger, poverty, and child mortality is
marred by escalating environmental degradation due to rising greenhouse gas
emissions and climate change impacts. Despite positive developments, ecosystems
are suffering globally. Regional strategies for mitigating and adapting to
climate change must be viewed from a global perspective. The 2015 UN
Sustainable Development Goals reflect the challenge of balancing social and
environmental aspects for sustainable development. Agriculture, vital for food
production, also threatens Earth systems. A study examines the interplay of
land-use impacts, modeling crop and livestock trade, and their effects on
climate, biodiversity, water, and land using a Partial-Equilibrium Agricultural
Sector Model. Different scenarios involving taxing externalities related to
Earth processes were tested. Results show synergies in reducing emissions,
biodiversity loss, water use, and phosphorus pollution, driven by shifts in
crop management. Nitrogen application and deforestation scenarios exhibit
weaker synergies and more conflicts. The study offers insights into SDG
interactions and the potential for sustainable farming."
3,"""This (Smart) Town Ain't Big Enough"": Smart Small Towns and Digital Twins for Sustainable Urban and Regional Development",Computers and Society,Gabriela Viale Pereira; Lukas Daniel Klausner; Lucy Temple; Thomas Delissen; Thomas Lampoltshammer; Torsten Priebe,09-August-2023,"One of the major challenges today lies in the creation of governance concepts
for regional development that not only promote growth but, at the same time,
ensure promotion of inclusiveness, fairness, and resilience. Digital twins can
support policymakers in developing smart, sustainable solutions for cities and
regions and, therefore, urban and non-urban environments. The project SCiNDTiLA
(Smart Cities aNd Digital Twins in Lower Austria) aims to define the
state-of-the-art in the field of smart cities, identify interdependencies,
critical components and stakeholders, and provide a roadmap for smart cities
with application to both smaller-scale urban and non-urban environments.
SCiNDTiLA uses the foundations of complexity theory and computational social
science methods to model Austrian towns and regions as smart cities/regions and
thus as systems of socio-technical interaction to guide policy decision-making
toward sustainable development."
4,Vascular Ageing and Smoking Habit Prediction via a Low-Cost Single-Lead ECG Module,Signal Processing,S. Anas Ali; M. Saqib Niaz; Mubashir Rehman; Ahsan Mehmood; M. Mahboob Ur Rahman; Kashif Riaz,08-August-2023,"This paper presents a novel low-cost method to predict: i) the vascular age
of a healthy young person, ii) whether or not a person is a smoker, using only
the lead-I of the electrocardiogram (ECG). We begin by collecting (lead-I) ECG
data from 42 healthy subjects (male, female, smoker, non-smoker) aged 18 to 30
years, using our custom-built low-cost single-lead ECG module, and
anthropometric data, e.g., body mass index, smoking status, blood pressure etc.
Under our proposed method, we first pre-process our dataset by denoising the
ECG traces, followed by baseline drift removal, followed by z-score
normalization. Next, we divide ECG traces into overlapping segments of
five-second duration, which leads to a 145-fold increase in the size of the
dataset. We then feed our dataset to a number of machine learning models, a 1D
convolutional neural network, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and ResNet18
transfer learning model. For vascular ageing prediction problem, Random Forest
method outperforms all other methods with an R2 score of 0.99, and mean squared
error of 0.07. For the binary classification problem that aims to differentiate
between a smoker and a non-smoker, XGBoost method stands out with an accuracy
of 96.5%. Finally, for the 4-class classification problem that aims to
differentiate between male smoker, female smoker, male non-smoker, and female
non-smoker, MLP method achieves the best accuracy of 97.5%. This work is
aligned with the sustainable development goals of the United Nations which aim
to provide low-cost but quality healthcare solutions to the unprivileged
population."
5,"Resource Management for GPT-based Model Deployed on Clouds: Challenges, Solutions, and Future Directions","Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing",Yongkang Dang; Minxian Xu; Kejiang Ye,05-August-2023,"The widespread adoption of the large language model (LLM), e.g. Generative
Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), deployed on cloud computing environment (e.g.
Azure) has led to a huge increased demand for resources. This surge in demand
poses significant challenges to resource management in clouds. This paper aims
to highlight these challenges by first identifying the unique characteristics
of resource management for the GPT-based model. Building upon this
understanding, we analyze the specific challenges faced by resource management
in the context of GPT-based model deployed on clouds, and propose corresponding
potential solutions. To facilitate effective resource management, we introduce
a comprehensive resource management framework and present resource scheduling
algorithms specifically designed for the GPT-based model. Furthermore, we delve
into the future directions for resource management in the GPT-based model,
highlighting potential areas for further exploration and improvement. Through
this study, we aim to provide valuable insights into resource management for
GPT-based models deployed in clouds and promote their sustainable development
for GPT-based models and applications."
6,Sustainable development-oriented campus bike-sharing site evaluation model: A case study of Henan Polytechnic University,Computers and Society,Huimin Qi; Xianghong Li; Kai Yin; Xiangnan Song; Xufei Fang,05-August-2023,"Promoting sustainable transportation options is increasingly crucial in the
pursuit of environmentally friendly and efficient campus mobility systems.
Among these options, bike-sharing programs have garnered substantial attention
for their capacity to mitigate traffic congestion, decrease carbon emissions,
and enhance overall campus sustainability. However, improper selection of
bike-sharing sites has led to the growing problems of unsustainable practices
in campus, including the disorderly parking and indiscriminate placement of
bike-sharing. To this end, this paper proposes a novel sustainable
development-oriented campus bike-sharing site evaluation model integrating the
improved Delphi and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation approaches. Fourteen
evaluation metrics are firstly selected from four dimensions: the user
features, implementation and usage characteristics of parking spots,
environmental sustainability, and social sustainability, through the
combination of expert experience and the improved Delphi method. Then, the
analytic hierarchy process and the entropy weight method are employed to
determine the weights of the evaluation indices, ensuring a robust and
objective assessment framework. The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is
finally implemented to evaluate the quality of location selection. South Campus
of Henan Polytechnic University is selected as a case study using the proposed
evaluation system. This work contributes to the existing body of knowledge by
presenting a comprehensive location selection evaluation system for campus
bike-sharing, informed by the principles of sustainable development."
7,Harnessing the Web and Knowledge Graphs for Automated Impact Investing Scoring,Machine Learning,Qingzhi Hu; Daniel Daza; Laurens Swinkels; Kristina Ūsaitė; Robbert-Jan 't Hoen; Paul Groth,04-August-2023,"The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were introduced by the United
Nations in order to encourage policies and activities that help guarantee human
prosperity and sustainability. SDG frameworks produced in the finance industry
are designed to provide scores that indicate how well a company aligns with
each of the 17 SDGs. This scoring enables a consistent assessment of
investments that have the potential of building an inclusive and sustainable
economy. As a result of the high quality and reliability required by such
frameworks, the process of creating and maintaining them is time-consuming and
requires extensive domain expertise. In this work, we describe a data-driven
system that seeks to automate the process of creating an SDG framework. First,
we propose a novel method for collecting and filtering a dataset of texts from
different web sources and a knowledge graph relevant to a set of companies. We
then implement and deploy classifiers trained with this data for predicting
scores of alignment with SDGs for a given company. Our results indicate that
our best performing model can accurately predict SDG scores with a micro
average F1 score of 0.89, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed
solution. We further describe how the integration of the models for its use by
humans can be facilitated by providing explanations in the form of data
relevant to a predicted score. We find that our proposed solution enables
access to a large amount of information that analysts would normally not be
able to process, resulting in an accurate prediction of SDG scores at a
fraction of the cost."
8,Supply chain emission estimation using large language models,Computation and Language,Ayush Jain; Manikandan Padmanaban; Jagabondhu Hazra; Shantanu Godbole; Kommy Weldemariam,03-August-2023,"Large enterprises face a crucial imperative to achieve the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs), especially goal 13, which focuses on combating
climate change and its impacts. To mitigate the effects of climate change,
reducing enterprise Scope 3 (supply chain emissions) is vital, as it accounts
for more than 90\% of total emission inventories. However, tracking Scope 3
emissions proves challenging, as data must be collected from thousands of
upstream and downstream suppliers.To address the above mentioned challenges, we
propose a first-of-a-kind framework that uses domain-adapted NLP foundation
models to estimate Scope 3 emissions, by utilizing financial transactions as a
proxy for purchased goods and services. We compared the performance of the
proposed framework with the state-of-art text classification models such as
TF-IDF, word2Vec, and Zero shot learning. Our results show that the
domain-adapted foundation model outperforms state-of-the-art text mining
techniques and performs as well as a subject matter expert (SME). The proposed
framework could accelerate the Scope 3 estimation at Enterprise scale and will
help to take appropriate climate actions to achieve SDG 13."
9,Quantifying the overall characteristics of urban mobility considering spatial information,Physics and Society,Hao Wang; Pengjun Zhao; Xiao-Yong Yan,02-August-2023,"Quantification of the overall characteristics of urban mobility using
coarse-grained methods is crucial for urban management, planning and
sustainable development. Although some recent studies have provided
quantification methods for coarse-grained numerical information regarding urban
mobility, a method that can simultaneously capture numerical and spatial
information remains an outstanding problem. Here, we use mathematical vectors
to depict human mobility, with mobility magnitude representing numerical
information and mobility direction representing spatial information. We then
define anisotropy and centripetality metrics by vector computation to measure
imbalance in direction distribution and orientation toward the city center of
mobility flows, respectively. As a case study, we apply our method to 60
Chinese cities and identify three mobility patterns: strong monocentric, weak
monocentric and polycentric. To better understand mobility pattern, we further
study the allometric scaling of the average commuting distance and the
spatiotemporal variations of the two metrics in different patterns. Finally, we
build a microscopic model to explain the key mechanisms driving the diversity
in anisotropy and centripetality. Our work offers a comprehensive method that
considers both numerical and spatial information to quantify and classify the
overall characteristics of urban mobility, enhancing our understanding of the
structure and evolution of urban mobility systems."
10,A Satellite Imagery Dataset for Long-Term Sustainable Development in United States Cities,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,Yanxin Xi; Yu Liu; Tong Li; Jintao Ding; Yunke Zhang; Sasu Tarkoma; Yong Li; Pan Hui,01-August-2023,"Cities play an important role in achieving sustainable development goals
(SDGs) to promote economic growth and meet social needs. Especially satellite
imagery is a potential data source for studying sustainable urban development.
However, a comprehensive dataset in the United States (U.S.) covering multiple
cities, multiple years, multiple scales, and multiple indicators for SDG
monitoring is lacking. To support the research on SDGs in U.S. cities, we
develop a satellite imagery dataset using deep learning models for five SDGs
containing 25 sustainable development indicators. The proposed dataset covers
the 100 most populated U.S. cities and corresponding Census Block Groups from
2014 to 2023. Specifically, we collect satellite imagery and identify objects
with state-of-the-art object detection and semantic segmentation models to
observe cities' bird's-eye view. We further gather population, nighttime light,
survey, and built environment data to depict SDGs regarding poverty, health,
education, inequality, and living environment. We anticipate the dataset to
help urban policymakers and researchers to advance SDGs-related studies,
especially applying satellite imagery to monitor long-term and multi-scale SDGs
in cities."
11,"Street access, Informality and Development: A block level analysis across all of sub-Saharan Africa",Physics and Society,Luis M. A Bettencourt; Nicholas Marchio,30-July-2023,"Sustainable development is an imperative worldwide but metrics and data on
poverty and quality of life have remained too coarse and abstract to
characterize challenges adequately and guide practical progress. Nowhere is
this challenge greater than in Africa where we still know relatively little
about the systematic spatial details and scope of development. Here, we
leverage a complete, high-precision dataset of building footprints to identify
infrastructure deficits and infer informal settlements down to the street level
everywhere in sub-Saharan Africa. We identify a general pattern of informality
with urbanized areas showing, on average, greater access to infrastructure and
services than rural and periurban areas, each characterized by a statistically
consistent spectrum of uneven local development. We show that our physical
measures of informality are systematically associated with many indicators of
low human development, and that these form a single principal component
predicted by specific functional changes of the built environment. These
results demonstrate that the localization of sustainable development is
possible down to the street level at a continental scale and provide a general
distributed strategy for accelerating progress in infrastructure and service
expansion that taps local innovations in a way that is equitable and context
appropriate."
12,Indicatori comuni del PNRR e framework SDGs: una proposta di indicatore composito,General Economics,Fabio Bacchini; Lorenzo Di Biagio; Giampiero M. Gallo; Vincenzo Spinelli,20-July-2023,"The main component of the NextGeneration EU (NGEU) program is the Recovery
and Resilience Facility (RRF), spanning an implementation period between 2021
and 2026. The RRF also includes a monitoring system: every six months, each
country is required to send an update on the progress of the plan against 14
common indicators, measured on specific quantitative scales. The aim of this
paper is to present the first empirical evidence on this system, while, at the
same time, emphasizing the potential of its integration with the sustainable
development framework (SDGs). We propose to develop a first linkage between the
14 common indicators and the SDGs which allows us to produce a composite index
(SDGs-RRF) for France, Germany, Italy, and Spain for the period 2014-2021. Over
this time, widespread improvements in the composite index across the four
countries led to a partial reduction of the divergence. The proposed approach
represents a first step towards a wider use of the SDGs for the assessment of
the RRF, in line with their use in the European Semester documents prepared by
the European Commission."
13,Mathematical modeling for sustainability: How can it promote sustainable learning in mathematics education?,History and Overview,N. Karjanto,20-July-2023,"This article reviews the current state of teaching and learning mathematical
modeling in the context of sustainable development goals for education at the
tertiary level. While ample research on mathematical modeling education and
published textbooks on the topic are available, there is a lack of focus on
mathematical modeling for sustainability. This review aims to address this gap
by exploring the powerful intersection of mathematical modeling and
sustainability. Mathematical modeling for sustainability connects two distinct
realms: learning about the mathematics of sustainability and promoting
sustainable learning in mathematics education. The former involves teaching and
learning sustainability quantitatively, while the latter encompasses pedagogy
that enables learners to apply quantitative knowledge and skills to everyday
life and continue learning and improving mathematically beyond formal
education. To demonstrate the practical application of mathematical modeling
for sustainability, we discuss a specific textbook suitable for a pilot liberal
arts course. We illustrate how learners can grasp mathematical concepts related
to sustainability through simple yet mathematically diverse examples, which can
be further developed for teaching such a course. Indeed, by filling the gap in
the literature and providing practical resources, this review contributes to
the advancement of mathematical modeling education in the context of
sustainability."
14,Resilience of the reported global human-nature interaction network to pandemic conditions,Social and Information Networks,Anne Cathrine Linder; David Lusseau,18-July-2023,"Understanding human-nature interactions and the architecture of coupled
human-nature systems is crucial for sustainable development. Cultural ecosystem
services (CES), defined as intangible benefits derived from nature exposure,
contribute to maintaining and improving human well-being. However, we have
limited understanding of how well-being benefits emerge from CES co-production.
In this study, for the first time, we estimated the global CES network from
self-reported interactions between nature features and human activities
underpinning CES co-production using social media. First, we used a bottom-up,
approach to define the global repertoire of nature features and human
activities used during CES co-production using 682,000 posts on Reddit. We then
sampled Twitter to estimate the co-occurrence of these features and activities
over the past five years, retrieving 41.7 millions tweets. These tweets were
used to estimate the CES bipartite network, where each link was weighted by the
number of times nature features and human activities co-occurred in tweets. We
expected to observe large changes in the CES network topology in relation to
the global mobility restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was not the
case and the global CES network was generally resilient. However, a higher
order singular value decomposition of the CES tensor revealed an impulse on the
link between self care activities and urban greenspace. This could be due to an
increased need for self care during the pandemic and urban greenspace enabling
CES to be produced locally. Thus, providing resilience for maintaining
well-being during the pandemic. Our user based analysis also indicated a shift
towards local CES production during the beginning of the pandemic. Thus,
supporting that CES was produced locally. These findings suggest an overall
need for CES and access to features providing CES in local communities."
15,Application of BERT in Wind Power Forecasting-Teletraan's Solution in Baidu KDD Cup 2022,Machine Learning,Longxing Tan; Hongying Yue,18-July-2023,"Nowadays, wind energy has drawn increasing attention as its important role in
carbon neutrality and sustainable development. When wind power is integrated
into the power grid, precise forecasting is necessary for the sustainability
and security of the system. However, the unpredictable nature and long sequence
prediction make it especially challenging. In this technical report, we
introduce the BERT model applied for Baidu KDD Cup 2022, and the daily
fluctuation is added by post-processing to make the predicted results in line
with daily periodicity. Our solution achieves 3rd place of 2490 teams. The code

16,The Climatological Renewable Energy Deviation Index,Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics,Laurens P. Stoop; Karin van der Wiel; William Zappa; Arno Haverkamp; Ad J. Feelders; Machteld van den Broek,18-July-2023,"Here we propose an index to quantify and analyse the impact of climatological
variability on the energy system at different timescales. We define the
Climatological Renewable Energy Deviation Index (CREDI) as the cumulative
anomaly of a renewable resource with respect to its climate over a specific
time period of interest. We analyse the index at decadal, annual and
(sub-)seasonal timescales using the forthcoming Pan-European Climate Database
and consider the starting point and window of analysis for its use at those
timescales. The CREDI is meant as an analytical tool for researchers and
stakeholders to help them quantify, understand, and explain, the impact of the
variability of weather on the energy system across timescales. Improved
understanding translates to better assessments of how renewable resources, and
the associated risks for energy security, may fare in current and future
climatological settings. The practical use of the index is in resource
planning. For example transmission system operators may be able to adjust
short-term planning to reduce adequacy issues before they occur or combine the
index with storyline event selection for improved assessments of climate change
related risks."
17,Data Discovery for the SDGs: A Systematic Rule-based Approach,Information Retrieval,Yuwei Jiang; David Johnson,16-July-2023,"In 2015, the United Nations put forward 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) to be achieved by 2030, where data has been promoted as a focus to
innovating sustainable development and as a means to measuring progress towards
achieving the SDGs. In this study, we propose a systematic approach towards
discovering data types and sources that can be used for SDG research. The
proposed method integrates a systematic mapping approach using manual
qualitative coding over a corpus of SDG-related research literature followed by
an automated process that applies rules to perform data entity extraction
computationally. This approach is exemplified by an analysis of literature
relating to SDG 7, the results of which are also presented in this paper. The
paper concludes with a discussion of the approach and suggests future work to
extend the method with more advance NLP and machine learning techniques."
18,Towards a 6G embedding sustainability,Networking and Internet Architecture,Esteban Selva; Azeddine Gati; Marie- Hélène Hamon; Giorgio Calochira; Giuseppe Avino; Bahare Masood Khorsandi; Stefan Wunderer; Stefan Wänstedt; Pernilla Bergmark; Serge Bories; Tommy Svensson; Marja Matinmikko-Blue,13-July-2023,"From its conception, 6G is being designed with a particular focus on
sustainability. The general philosophy of the H2020 Hexa-X project work on
sustainability in 6G is based on two principles: to reduce direct negative life
cycle impacts of 6G systems as much as possible (Sustainable 6G) and to analyze
use cases that maximize positive environmental, social, and economic effects in
other sectors of society (6G for Sustainability or its enablement effect). To
apply this philosophy, Hexa-X is designing 6G with three sustainability
objectives in mind: to enable the reduction of emissions in 6G-powered sectors
of society, to reduce the total cost of ownership and to improve energy
efficiency. This paper describes these objectives, their associated KPIs and
quantitative targets, and the levers to reach them. Furthermore, to maximize
the positive effects of 6G through the enablement effect, a link between 6G and
the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) framework is
proposed and illustrated by Hexa-X use case families."
19,Peru Mining: Analysis and Forecast of Mining Production in Peru Using Time Series and Data Science Techniques,Other Statistics,Yhack Bryan Aycaya-Paco; Lindell Dennis Vilca-Mamani; Fred Torres-Cruz,12-July-2023,"Peruvian mining plays a crucial role in the country's economy, being one of
the main producers and exporters of minerals worldwide. In this project, an
application was developed in RStudio that utilizes statistical analysis and
time series modeling techniques to understand and forecast mineral extraction
in different departments of Peru. The application includes an interactive map
that allows users to explore Peruvian geography and obtain detailed statistics
by clicking on each department. Additionally, bar charts, pie charts, and
frequency polygons were implemented to visualize and analyze the data. Using
the ARIMA model, predictions were made on the future extraction of minerals,
enabling informed decision-making in planning and resource management within
the mining sector. The application provides an interactive and accessible tool
to explore the Peruvian mining industry, comprehend trends, and make accurate
forecasts. These predictions for 2027 in total annual production are as
follows: Copper = 2,694,957 MT, Gold = 72,817.47 kg Fine, Zinc = 1,369,649 MT,
Silver = 3,083,036 MT, Lead = 255,443 MT, Iron = 15,776,609 MT, Tin = 29,542
MT, Molybdenum = 35,044.66 MT, and Cadmium = 724 MT. These predictions, based
on historical data, provide valuable information for strategic decision-making
and contribute to the sustainable development of the mining industry in Peru."
20,International Institutions for Advanced AI,Computers and Society,Lewis Ho; Joslyn Barnhart; Robert Trager; Yoshua Bengio; Miles Brundage; Allison Carnegie; Rumman Chowdhury; Allan Dafoe; Gillian Hadfield; Margaret Levi; Duncan Snidal,10-July-2023,"International institutions may have an important role to play in ensuring
advanced AI systems benefit humanity. International collaborations can unlock
AI's ability to further sustainable development, and coordination of regulatory
efforts can reduce obstacles to innovation and the spread of benefits.
Conversely, the potential dangerous capabilities of powerful and
general-purpose AI systems create global externalities in their development and
deployment, and international efforts to further responsible AI practices could
help manage the risks they pose. This paper identifies a set of governance
functions that could be performed at an international level to address these
challenges, ranging from supporting access to frontier AI systems to setting
international safety standards. It groups these functions into four
institutional models that exhibit internal synergies and have precedents in
existing organizations: 1) a Commission on Frontier AI that facilitates expert
consensus on opportunities and risks from advanced AI, 2) an Advanced AI
Governance Organization that sets international standards to manage global
threats from advanced models, supports their implementation, and possibly
monitors compliance with a future governance regime, 3) a Frontier AI
Collaborative that promotes access to cutting-edge AI, and 4) an AI Safety
Project that brings together leading researchers and engineers to further AI
safety research. We explore the utility of these models and identify open
questions about their viability."
21,Hydrogen from Cellulose and Low-density Polyethylene via Atmospheric Pressure Nonthermal Plasma,Plasma Physics,Benard Tabu; Visal Veng; Heba Morgan; Shubhra Kanti Das; Eric Brack; Todd Alexander; J. Hunter Mack; Hsi-Wu Wong; Juan Pablo Trelles,09-July-2023,"The valorization of waste, by creating economic value while limiting
environmental impact, can have an essential role in sustainable development.
Particularly, polymeric waste such as biomass and plastics can be used for the
production of green hydrogen as a carbon-free energy carrier through the use of
nonthermal plasma powered by renewable, potentially surplus, electricity. In
this study, a Streamer Dielectric-Barrier Discharge (SDBD) reactor is designed
and built to extract hydrogen and carbon co-products from cellulose and
low-density polyethylene (LDPE) as model feedstocks of biomass and plastic
waste, respectively. Spectroscopic and electrical diagnostics, together with
modeling, are used to estimate representative plasma properties, namely
electron and excitation temperatures, number density, and power consumption.
Cellulose and LDPE are plasma-treated for different treatment times to
characterize the evolution of the hydrogen production process. Gas products are
analyzed using gas chromatography to determine the mean hydrogen production
rate, production efficiency, hydrogen yield, selectivity, and energy cost. The
results show that the maximum hydrogen production efficiency for cellulose is
0.8 mol/kWh, which is approximately double that for LDPE. Furthermore, the
energy cost of hydrogen production from cellulose is 600 kWh/kg of H2, half
that of LDPE. Solid products are examined via scanning electron microscopy,
revealing the distinct morphological structure of the two feedstocks treated,
as well as by elemental composition analysis. The results demonstrate that SDBD
plasma is effective at producing hydrogen from cellulose and LDPE at near
atmospheric pressure and relatively low-temperature conditions in
rapid-response and compact processes."
22,High Altitude Platform Stations: the New Network Energy Efficiency Enabler in the 6G Era,Networking and Internet Architecture,Tailai Song; David Lopez; Michela Meo; Nicola Piovesan; Daniela Renga,03-July-2023,"The rapidly evolving communication landscape, with the advent of 6G
technology, brings new challenges to the design and operation of wireless
networks. One of the key concerns is the energy efficiency of the Radio Access
Network (RAN), as the exponential growth in wireless traffic demands
increasingly higher energy consumption. In this paper, we assess the potential
of integrating a High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) to improve the energy
efficiency of a RAN, and quantify the potential energy conservation through
meticulously designed simulations. We propose a quantitative framework based on
real traffic patterns to estimate the energy consumption of the HAPS integrated
RAN and compare it with the conventional terrestrial RAN. Our simulation
results elucidate that HAPS can significantly reduce energy consumption by up
to almost 30\% by exploiting the unique advantages of HAPS, such as its
self-sustainability, high altitude, and wide coverage. We further analyze the
impact of different system parameters on performance, and provide insights for
the design and optimization of future 6G networks. Our work sheds light on the
potential of HAPS integrated RAN to mitigate the energy challenges in the 6G
era, and contributes to the sustainable development of wireless communications."
23,S2SNet: A Pretrained Neural Network for Superconductivity Discovery,Superconductivity,Ke Liu; Kaifan Yang; Jiahong Zhang; Renjun Xu,28-June-2023,"Superconductivity allows electrical current to flow without any energy loss,
and thus making solids superconducting is a grand goal of physics, material
science, and electrical engineering. More than 16 Nobel Laureates have been
awarded for their contribution to superconductivity research. Superconductors
are valuable for sustainable development goals (SDGs), such as climate change
mitigation, affordable and clean energy, industry, innovation and
infrastructure, and so on. However, a unified physics theory explaining all
superconductivity mechanism is still unknown. It is believed that
superconductivity is microscopically due to not only molecular compositions but
also the geometric crystal structure. Hence a new dataset, S2S, containing both
crystal structures and superconducting critical temperature, is built upon
SuperCon and Material Project. Based on this new dataset, we propose a novel
model, S2SNet, which utilizes the attention mechanism for superconductivity
prediction. To overcome the shortage of data, S2SNet is pre-trained on the
whole Material Project dataset with Masked-Language Modeling (MLM). S2SNet
makes a new state-of-the-art, with out-of-sample accuracy of 92% and Area Under
Curve (AUC) of 0.92. To the best of our knowledge, S2SNet is the first work to
predict superconductivity with only information of crystal structures. This
work is beneficial to superconductivity discovery and further SDGs. Code and
datasets are available in https://github.com/zjuKeLiu/S2SNet"
24,Towards Sustainable Ultrawide Bandgap Van der Waals Materials: An ab initio Screening Effort,Materials Science,Chuin Wei Tan; Linqiang Xu; Hui Ying Yang; Shengyuan A. Yang; Jing Lu; Yee Sin Ang,26-June-2023,"The sustainable development of next-generation device technology is paramount
in the face of climate change and the looming energy crisis. Tremendous efforts
have been made in the discovery and design of nanomaterials that achieve
device-level sustainability, where high performance and low operational energy
cost are prioritized. However, many of such materials are composed of elements
that are under threat of depletion and pose elevated risks to the environment.
The role of material-level sustainability in computational screening efforts
remains an open question thus far. Here we develop a general van der Waals
materials screening framework imbued with sustainability-motivated search
criteria. Using ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) materials as a backdrop -- an emerging
materials class with great prospects in dielectric, power electronics, and
ultraviolet device applications, we demonstrate how this screening framework
results in 25 sustainable UWBG layered materials comprising only of low-risks
elements. Our findings constitute a critical first-step towards reinventing a
more sustainable electronics landscape beyond silicon, with the framework

25,Exploring the Nexus between Exhaustible Human Resources and Economic Development in China: An Application of the Hotelling Model,General Economics,Zhiwei Yang,21-June-2023,"This paper applies the Hotelling model to the context of exhaustible human
resources in China. We find that over-exploitation of human resources occurs
under conditions of restricted population mobility, rigid wage levels, and
increased foreign trade demand elasticity. Conversely, the existence of
technological replacements for human resources or improvements in the
utilization rate of human resources leads to conservation. Our analysis
provides practical insights for policy-making towards sustainable development."
26,AI Clinics on Mobile (AICOM): Universal AI Doctors for the Underserved and Hard-to-Reach,Artificial Intelligence,Tim Tianyi Yang; Tom Tianze Yang; Na An; Ao Kong; Shaoshan Liu; Steve Xue Liu,17-June-2023,"This paper introduces Artificial Intelligence Clinics on Mobile (AICOM), an
open-source project devoted to answering the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goal 3 (SDG3) on health, which represents a universal recognition
that health is fundamental to human capital and social and economic
development. The core motivation for the AICOM project is the fact that over
80% of the people in the least developed countries (LDCs) own a mobile phone,
even though less than 40% of these people have internet access. Hence, through
enabling AI-based disease diagnostics and screening capability on affordable
mobile phones without connectivity will be a critical first step to addressing
healthcare access problems. The technologies developed in the AICOM project
achieve exactly this goal, and we have demonstrated the effectiveness of AICOM
on monkeypox screening tasks. We plan to continue expanding and open-sourcing
the AICOM platform, aiming for it to evolve into an universal AI doctor for the
Underserved and Hard-to-Reach."
27,Understanding the Application of Utility Theory in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence: A Survey,Robotics,Qin Yang; Rui Liu,15-June-2023,"As a unifying concept in economics, game theory, and operations research,
even in the Robotics and AI field, the utility is used to evaluate the level of
individual needs, preferences, and interests. Especially for decision-making
and learning in multi-agent/robot systems (MAS/MRS), a suitable utility model
can guide agents in choosing reasonable strategies to achieve their current
needs and learning to cooperate and organize their behaviors, optimizing the
system's utility, building stable and reliable relationships, and guaranteeing
each group member's sustainable development, similar to the human society.
Although these systems' complex, large-scale, and long-term behaviors are
strongly determined by the fundamental characteristics of the underlying
relationships, there has been less discussion on the theoretical aspects of
mechanisms and the fields of applications in Robotics and AI. This paper
introduces a utility-orient needs paradigm to describe and evaluate inter and
outer relationships among agents' interactions. Then, we survey existing
literature in relevant fields to support it and propose several promising
research directions along with some open problems deemed necessary for further
investigations."
28,Carbon emissions and sustainability of launching 5G mobile networks in China,Systems and Control,Tong Li; Li Yu; Yibo Ma; Tong Duan; Wenzhen Huang; Yan Zhou; Depeng Jin; Yong Li; Tao Jiang,14-June-2023,"Since 2021, China has deployed more than 2.1 million 5G base stations to
increase the network capacity and provide ubiquitous digital connectivity for
mobile terminals. However, the launch of 5G networks also exacerbates the
misalignment between cellular traffic and energy consumption, which reduces
carbon efficiency - the amount of network traffic that can be delivered for
each unit of carbon emission. In this study, we develop a large-scale
data-driven framework to estimate the carbon emissions induced by mobile
networks. We show that the decline in carbon efficiency leads to a carbon
efficiency trap, estimated to cause additional carbon emissions of 23.82 +-
1.07 megatons in China. To mitigate the misalignment and improve energy
efficiency, we propose DeepEnergy, an energy-saving method leveraging
collaborative deep reinforcement learning and graph neural networks. DeepEnergy
models complex collaboration among cells, making it possible to effectively
coordinate the working state of tens of thousands of cells, which could help
over 71% of Chinese provinces avoid carbon efficiency traps. In addition,
applying DeepEnergy is estimated to reduce 20.90 +- 0.98 megatons of carbon
emissions at the national level in 2023. We further assess the effects of
adopting renewable energy and discover that the mobile network could accomplish
more than 50% of its net-zero goal by integrating DeepEnergy and solar energy
systems. Our study provides insight into carbon emission mitigation in 5G
network infrastructure launching in China and overworld, paving the way towards
achieving sustainable development goals and future net-zero mobile networks."
29,Mapping Global Value Chains at the Product Level,General Economics,Lea Karbevska; César A. Hidalgo,12-June-2023,"Value chain data is crucial to navigate economic disruptions, such as those
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Yet, despite its
importance, publicly available value chain datasets, such as the ``World
Input-Output Database'', ``Inter-Country Input-Output Tables'', ``EXIOBASE'' or
the ``EORA'', lack detailed information about products (e.g. Radio Receivers,
Telephones, Electrical Capacitors, LCDs, etc.) and rely instead on more
aggregate industrial sectors (e.g. Electrical Equipment, Telecommunications).
Here, we introduce a method based on machine learning and trade theory to infer
product-level value chain relationships from fine-grained international trade
data. We apply our method to data summarizing the exports and imports of 300+
world regions (e.g. states in the U.S., prefectures in Japan, etc.) and 1200+
products to infer value chain information implicit in their trade patterns.
Furthermore, we use proportional allocation to assign the trade flow between
regions and countries. This work provides an approximate method to map value
chain data at the product level with a relevant trade flow, that should be of
interest to people working in logistics, trade, and sustainable development."
