0,An Efficient Distributed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for EV Charging Network Control,Multiagent Systems,Amin Shojaeighadikolaei; Morteza Hashemi,24-August-2023,"The increasing trend in adopting electric vehicles (EVs) will significantly
impact the residential electricity demand, which results in an increased risk
of transformer overload in the distribution grid. To mitigate such risks, there
are urgent needs to develop effective EV charging controllers. Currently, the
majority of the EV charge controllers are based on a centralized approach for
managing individual EVs or a group of EVs. In this paper, we introduce a
decentralized Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) charging framework that
prioritizes the preservation of privacy for EV owners. We employ the
Centralized Training Decentralized Execution-Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(CTDE-DDPG) scheme, which provides valuable information to users during
training while maintaining privacy during execution. Our results demonstrate
that the CTDE framework improves the performance of the charging network by
reducing the network costs. Moreover, we show that the Peak-to-Average Ratio
(PAR) of the total demand is reduced, which, in turn, reduces the risk of
transformer overload during the peak hours."
1,A Human-on-the-Loop Optimization Autoformalism Approach for Sustainability,Artificial Intelligence,Ming Jin; Bilgehan Sel; Fnu Hardeep; Wotao Yin,20-August-2023,"This paper outlines a natural conversational approach to solving personalized
energy-related problems using large language models (LLMs). We focus on
customizable optimization problems that necessitate repeated solving with
slight variations in modeling and are user-specific, hence posing a challenge
to devising a one-size-fits-all model. We put forward a strategy that augments
an LLM with an optimization solver, enhancing its proficiency in understanding
and responding to user specifications and preferences while providing nonlinear
reasoning capabilities. Our approach pioneers the novel concept of human-guided
optimization autoformalism, translating a natural language task specification
automatically into an optimization instance. This enables LLMs to analyze,
explain, and tackle a variety of instance-specific energy-related problems,
pushing beyond the limits of current prompt-based techniques.
  Our research encompasses various commonplace tasks in the energy sector, from
electric vehicle charging and Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
control to long-term planning problems such as cost-benefit evaluations for
installing rooftop solar photovoltaics (PVs) or heat pumps. This pilot study
marks an essential stride towards the context-based formulation of optimization
using LLMs, with the potential to democratize optimization processes. As a
result, stakeholders are empowered to optimize their energy consumption,
promoting sustainable energy practices customized to personal needs and
preferences."
2,Exploring the Role of Perceived Range Anxiety in Adoption Behavior of Plug-in Electric Vehicles,General Economics,Fatemeh Nazari; Abolfazl Mohammadian; Thomas Stephens,20-August-2023,"A sustainable solution to negative externalities imposed by road
transportation is replacing internal combustion vehicles with electric vehicles
(EVs), especially plug-in EV (PEV) encompassing plug-in hybrid EV (PHEV) and
battery EV (BEV). However, EV market share is still low and is forecast to
remain low and uncertain. This shows a research need for an in-depth
understanding of EV adoption behavior with a focus on one of the main barriers
to the mass EV adoption, which is the limited electric driving range. The
present study extends the existing literature in two directions; First, the
influence of the psychological aspect of driving range, which is referred to as
range anxiety, is explored on EV adoption behavior by presenting a nested logit
(NL) model with a latent construct. Second, the two-level NL model captures
individuals' decision on EV adoption behavior distinguished by vehicle
transaction type and EV type, where the upper level yields the vehicle
transaction type selected from the set of alternatives including
no-transaction, sell, trade, and add. The fuel type of the vehicles decided to
be acquired, either as traded-for or added vehicles, is simultaneously
determined at the lower level from a set including conventional vehicle, hybrid
EV, PHEV, and BEV. The model is empirically estimated using a stated
preferences dataset collected in the State of California. A notable finding is
that anxiety about driving range influences the preference for BEV, especially
as an added than traded-for vehicle, but not the decision on PHEV adoption."
3,Stochastic Optimization of Coupled Power Distribution-Urban Transportation Network Operations with Autonomous Mobility on Demand Systems,Systems and Control,Han Wang; Xiaoyuan Xu; Yue Chen; Zheng Yan; Mohammad Shahidehpour; Jiaqi Li; Shaolun Xu,20-August-2023,"Autonomous mobility on demand systems (AMoDS) will significantly affect the
operation of coupled power distribution-urban transportation networks (PTNs) by
the optimal dispatch of electric vehicles (EVs). This paper proposes an
uncertainty method to analyze the operational states of PTNs with AMoDS. First,
a PTN operation framework is designed considering the controllable EVs
dispatched by AMoDS as well as the uncontrollable driving behaviors of other
vehicle users. Then, a bi-level power-traffic flow (PTF) model is proposed to
characterize the interaction of power distribution networks (PDNs) and urban
transportation networks (UTNs). In the upper level, a social optimum model is
established to minimize the operating cost of PDNs and UTNs embedded with
controllable EVs. In the lower level, a stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) model
is established to minimize the operating cost of uncontrollable EVs and
gasoline vehicles (GVs) in UTNs. Finally, a probabilistic PTF analysis method
is developed to evaluate PTN operations under environmental and human
uncertainties. A regional sensitivity analysis method is proposed to identify
the critical uncertainties and quantify the impacts of their distribution
ranges on PTN operations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified
by the PTN consisting of a 21-bus PDN and a 20-node UTN."
4,DiffCharge: Generating EV Charging Scenarios via a Denoising Diffusion Model,Systems and Control,Siyang Li; Hui Xiong; Yize Chen,18-August-2023,"Recent proliferation of electric vehicle (EV) charging events has brought
prominent stress over power grid operation. Due to the stochastic and volatile
EV charging behaviors, the induced charging loads are extremely uncertain,
posing modeling and control challenges for grid operators and charging
management. Generating EV charging scenarios would aid via synthesizing a
myriad of realistic charging scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel
denoising Diffusion-based Charging scenario generation model DiffCharge, which
is capable of generating a broad variety of realistic EV charging profiles with
distinctive temporal properties. It is able to progressively convert the simply
known Gaussian noise to genuine charging time-series data, by learning a
parameterized reversal of a forward diffusion process. Besides, we leverage the
multi-head self-attention and prior conditions to capture the temporal
correlations and unique information associated with EV or charging station
types in real charging profiles. Moreover, We demonstrate the superiority of
DiffCharge on extensive real-world charging datasets, as well as the efficacy
on EV integration in power distribution grids."
5,Towards Trustworthy NFC-based Sensor Readout for Battery Packs in Battery Management Systems,Systems and Control,Fikret Basic; Martin Gaertner; Christian Steger,18-August-2023,"In the last several years, wireless Battery Management Systems (BMS) have
slowly become a topic of interest from both academia and industry. It came from
a necessity derived from the increased production and use in different systems,
including the electrical vehicles. Wireless communication allows for a more
flexible and cost-efficient sensor installation in battery packs. However, many
wireless technologies, such as those that use the 2.4 GHz frequency band,
suffer from the interference limitations that need to be addressed. In this
paper we present an alternative approach to communication in BMS that relies on
the use of Near Field Communication (NFC) technology for battery sensor
readouts. Due to a vital concern over the counterfeited battery pack products,
security measures are also considered. To this end, we propose the use of an
effective, and easy to integrate, authentication schema that is supported by
the dedicated NFC devices. To test the usability of our design, a demonstrator
using the targeted devices was implemented and evaluated."
6,Federated Reinforcement Learning for Electric Vehicles Charging Control on Distribution Networks,Systems and Control,Junkai Qian; Yuning Jiang; Xin Liu; Qing Wang; Ting Wang; Yuanming Shi; Wei Chen,17-August-2023,"With the growing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), maintaining power
grid stability has become a significant challenge. To address this issue, EV
charging control strategies have been developed to manage the switch between
vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) modes for EVs. In this context,
multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) has proven its effectiveness in
EV charging control. However, existing MADRL-based approaches fail to consider
the natural power flow of EV charging/discharging in the distribution network
and ignore driver privacy. To deal with these problems, this paper proposes a
novel approach that combines multi-EV charging/discharging with a radial
distribution network (RDN) operating under optimal power flow (OPF) to
distribute power flow in real time. A mathematical model is developed to
describe the RDN load. The EV charging control problem is formulated as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP) to find an optimal charging control strategy that
balances V2G profits, RDN load, and driver anxiety. To effectively learn the
optimal EV charging control strategy, a federated deep reinforcement learning
algorithm named FedSAC is further proposed. Comprehensive simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed algorithm in
terms of the diversity of the charging control strategy, the power fluctuations
on RDN, the convergence efficiency, and the generalization ability."
7,Protecting the Future Grid: An Electric Vehicle Robust Mitigation Scheme Against Load Altering Attacks on Power Grids,Systems and Control,Mohammad Ali Sayed; Mohsen Ghafouri; Ribal Atallah; Mourad Debbabi; Chadi Assi,15-August-2023,"Due to the growing threat of climate change, the worlds governments have been
encouraging the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs). As a result, EV numbers
have been growing exponentially which will introduce a large EV charging load
into the power grid. On this basis, we present a scheme to utilize EVs as a
defense mechanism to mitigate Load-Altering (LA) attacks against the grid. The
developed scheme relies on robust control theory and Linear Matrix Inequalities
(LMIs). Our EV-based defense mechanism is formulated as a feedback controller
synthesized using H-2 and H-infinity control techniques to eliminate the impact
of unknown LA attacks. The controller synthesis considers the grid topology and
the uncertainties of the EV connection to the grid. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed mitigation scheme, it is tested against three
types of LA attacks on the New England 39-bus grid. We test our mitigation
scheme against 800 MW static, switching, and dynamic attacks in the presence of
multiple sources of uncertainty that can affect the EV load during deployment.
The results demonstrate how the grid remains stable under the LA attacks that
would otherwise lead to serious instabilities."
8,Challenges and Opportunities for Second-life Batteries: A Review of Key Technologies and Economy,Systems and Control,Xubo Gu; Hanyu Bai; Xiaofan Cui; Juner Zhu; Weichao Zhuang; Zhaojian Li; Xiaosong Hu; Ziyou Song,13-August-2023,"Due to the increasing volume of Electric Vehicles in automotive markets and
the limited lifetime of onboard lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the large-scale
retirement of LIBs is imminent. The battery packs retired from Electric
Vehicles still own 70%-80% of the initial capacity, thus having the potential
to be utilized in scenarios with lower energy and power requirements to
maximize the value of LIBs. However, spent batteries are commonly less reliable
than fresh batteries due to their degraded performance, thereby necessitating a
comprehensive assessment from safety and economic perspectives before further
utilization. To this end, this paper reviews the key technological and economic
aspects of second-life batteries (SLBs). Firstly, we introduce various
degradation models for first-life batteries and identify an opportunity to
combine physics-based theories with data-driven methods to establish
explainable models with physical laws that can be generalized. However,
degradation models specifically tailored to SLBs are currently absent.
Therefore, we analyze the applicability of existing battery degradation models
developed for first-life batteries in SLB applications. Secondly, we
investigate fast screening and regrouping techniques and discuss the regrouping
standards for the first time to guide the classification procedure and enhance
the performance and safety of SLBs. Thirdly, we scrutinize the economic
analysis of SLBs and summarize the potentially profitable applications.
Finally, we comprehensively examine and compare power electronics technologies
that can substantially improve the performance of SLBs, including
high-efficiency energy transformation technologies, active equalization
technologies, and technologies to improve reliability and safety."
9,Optimal EV Charging Decisions Considering Charging Rate Characteristics and Congestion Effects,Computer Science and Game Theory,Lihui Yi; Ermin Wei,11-August-2023,"With the rapid growth in the demand for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs), the
corresponding charging infrastructures are expanding. These charging stations
are located at various places and with different congestion levels. EV drivers
face an important decision in choosing which charging station to go to in order
to reduce their overall time costs. However, existing literature either assumes
a flat charging rate and hence overlooks the physical characteristics of an EV
battery where charging rate is typically reduced as the battery charges, or
ignores the effect of other drivers on an EV's decision making process. In this
paper, we consider both the predetermined exogenous wait cost and the
endogenous congestion induced by other drivers' strategic decisions, and
propose a differential equation based approach to find the optimal strategies.
We analytically characterize the equilibrium strategies and find that
co-located EVs may make different decisions depending on the charging rate
and/or remaining battery levels. Through numerical experiments, we investigate
the impact of charging rate characteristics, modeling parameters and the
consideration of endogenous congestion levels on the optimal charging
decisions. Finally, we conduct numerical studies on real-world data and find
that some EV users with slower charging rates may benefit from the
participation of fast-charging EVs."
10,A High-efficient Battery Charging System for Electric Vehicle,Systems and Control,Zexuan Li,09-August-2023,"Nowadays, automobile is facing the trend of electrification. Lithium-ion
batteries is widely used as their power supplies. Lithium-ion battery has
complex characteristics, as a result, Lithium-ion battery needs optimal
charging strategies to make sure it is charged safely and efficiently. This
paper focuses on development of a high-efficient charging method for
lithium-ion battery. To test different charging strategies, the electric
vehicle charging system consisting of a dual active bridge DC-DC converter and
a Thevenin battery model is implemented. Multistage constant current charging
(MSCC) and multistage constant current reflex charging (MSCC with reflex
charging) were proposed. Compared with the traditional constant voltage
constant current (CC-CV) charging method, MSCC can reduce 12% of the charging
time and 1.1% of the battery loss; MSCC with reflex charging has a 10.45% and a
1.54% reduction of charging time and battery loss separately."
11,On Data-Driven Modeling and Control in Modern Power Grids Stability: Survey and Perspective,Systems and Control,Xun Gong; Xiaozhe Wang; Bo Cao,07-August-2023,"Modern power grids are fast evolving with the increasing volatile renewable
generation, distributed energy resources (DERs) and time-varying operating
conditions. The DERs include rooftop photovoltaic (PV), small wind turbines,
energy storages, flexible loads, electric vehicles (EVs), etc. The grid control
is confronted with low inertia, uncertainty and nonlinearity that challenge the
operation security, efficacy and efficiency. The ongoing digitization of power
grids provides opportunities to address the challenges with data-driven and
control. This paper provides a comprehensive review of emerging data-driven
dynamical modeling and control methods and their various applications in power
grid. Future trends are also discussed based on advances in data-driven
control."
12,Exploring Different Time-series-Transformer (TST) Architectures: A Case Study in Battery Life Prediction for Electric Vehicles (EVs),Machine Learning,Niranjan Sitapure; Atharva Kulkarni,07-August-2023,"In recent years, battery technology for electric vehicles (EVs) has been a
major focus, with a significant emphasis on developing new battery materials
and chemistries. However, accurately predicting key battery parameters, such as
state-of-charge (SOC) and temperature, remains a challenge for constructing
advanced battery management systems (BMS). Existing battery models do not
comprehensively cover all parameters affecting battery performance, including
non-battery-related factors like ambient temperature, cabin temperature,
elevation, and regenerative braking during EV operation. Due to the difficulty
of incorporating these auxiliary parameters into traditional models, a
data-driven approach is suggested. Time-series-transformers (TSTs), leveraging
multiheaded attention and parallelization-friendly architecture, are explored
alongside LSTM models. Novel TST architectures, including encoder TST + decoder
LSTM and a hybrid TST-LSTM, are also developed and compared against existing
models. A dataset comprising 72 driving trips in a BMW i3 (60 Ah) is used to
address battery life prediction in EVs, aiming to create accurate TST models
that incorporate environmental, battery, vehicle driving, and heating circuit
data to predict SOC and battery temperature for future time steps."
13,Optimal battery thermal management for electric vehicles with battery degradation minimization,Systems and Control,Yue Wu; Zhiwu Huang; Dongjun Li; Heng Li; Jun Peng; Daniel Stroe; Ziyou Song,06-August-2023,"The control of a battery thermal management system (BTMS) is essential for
the thermal safety, energy efficiency, and durability of electric vehicles
(EVs) in hot weather. To address the battery cooling optimization problem, this
paper utilizes dynamic programming (DP) to develop an online rule-based control
strategy. Firstly, an electrical-thermal-aging model of the $\rm LiFePO_4$
battery pack is established. A control-oriented onboard BTMS model is proposed
and verified under different speed profiles and temperatures. Then in the DP
framework, a cost function consisting of battery aging cost and cooling-induced
electricity cost is minimized to obtain the optimal compressor power. By
exacting three rules ""fast cooling, slow cooling, and temperature-maintaining""
from the DP result, a near-optimal rule-based cooling strategy, which uses as
much regenerative energy as possible to cool the battery pack, is proposed for
online execution. Simulation results show that the proposed online strategy can
dramatically improve the driving economy and reduce battery degradation under
diverse operation conditions, achieving less than a 3% difference in battery
loss compared to the offline DP. Recommendations regarding battery cooling
under different real-world cases are finally provided."
14,"Prospects For A New Light-Nuclei, Fission-Fusion Energy Cycle",Physics and Society,R. V. Duncan; Cuikun Lin; Andrew K. Gillespie; John Gahl,02-August-2023,"Future advanced nuclear rocket propulsion, and the availability of new
nuclear power cycle designs, will benefit substantially from the large current
investment in alternative nuclear energy that is underway today. We propose a
new nuclear cycle which includes the primary fission of lithium-6, followed by
secondary fusion of deuterium and tritium, and a secondary fission of lithium-7
by tritium. This cycle does not produce nuclear waste from its nuclear fuel,
since all byproducts of these cascade reactions are stable, provided that the
triton production during the primary reaction is fully consumed in the
secondary reactions. This cycle may, however, activate surrounding technical
materials from its neutron flux. This light-element nuclear fuel is readily
obtained through the ongoing expansion of the lithium mining industry and
electric vehicle (EV) battery recycling industries."
15,A Real-Time Robust Ecological-Adaptive Cruise Control Strategy for Battery Electric Vehicles,Systems and Control,Sheng Yu; Xiao Pan; Anastasis Georgiou; Boli Chen; Imad M. Jaimoukha; Simos A. Evangelou,02-August-2023,"This work addresses the ecological-adaptive cruise control problem for
connected electric vehicles by a computationally efficient robust control
strategy. The problem is formulated in the space-domain with a realistic
description of the nonlinear electric powertrain model and motion dynamics to
yield a convex optimal control problem (OCP). The OCP is approached by a novel
robust model predictive control (RMPC) method handling various disturbances due
to modelling mismatch and inaccurate leading vehicle information. The RMPC
problem is solved by semi-definite programming relaxation and single linear
matrix inequality (sLMI) techniques for further enhanced computational
efficiency. The performance of the proposed real-time robust
ecological-adaptive cruise control (REACC) method is evaluated using an
experimentally collected driving cycle. Its robustness is verified by
comparison with a nominal MPC which is shown to result in speed-limit
constraint violations. The energy economy of the proposed method outperforms a
state-of-the-art time-domain RMPC scheme, as a more precisely fitted convex
powertrain model can be integrated into the space-domain scheme. The additional
comparison with a traditional constant distance following strategy (CDFS)
further verifies the effectiveness of the proposed REACC. Finally, it is
verified that the REACC can be potentially implemented in real-time owing to
the sLMI and resulting convex algorithm."
16,Integrating Optimal EV Charging in the Energy Management of Electric Railway Stations,Systems and Control,Georgia Pierrou; Gabriela Hug,02-August-2023,"In this paper, an electric railway Energy Management System (EMS) with
integration of an Energy Storage System (ESS), Regenerative Braking Energy
(RBE), and renewable generation is proposed to minimize the daily operating
costs of the railway station while meeting railway and Electric Vehicle (EV)
charging demand. Compared to other railway EMS methods, the proposed approach
integrates an optimal EV charging policy at the railway station to avoid high
power demand due to charging requirements. Specifically, receding horizon
control is leveraged to minimize the daily peak power spent on EV charging. The
numerical study on an actual railway station in Chur, Switzerland shows that
the proposed method that integrates railway demand and optimal EV charging
along with ESS, RBE, and renewable generation can significantly reduce the
average daily operating cost of the railway station over a large number of
different scenarios while ensuring that peak load capacity limits are
respected."
17,Artificial-Intelligence-Based Hybrid Extended Phase Shift Modulation for the Dual Active Bridge Converter with Full ZVS Range and Optimal Efficiency,Systems and Control,Xinze Li; Xin Zhang; Fanfan Lin; Changjiang Sun; Kezhi Mao,01-August-2023,"Dual active bridge (DAB) converter is the key enabler in many popular
applications such as wireless charging, electric vehicle and renewable energy.
ZVS range and efficiency are two significant performance indicators for DAB
converter. To obtain the desired ZVS and efficiency performance, modulation
should be carefully designed. Hybrid modulation considers several single
modulation strategies to achieve good comprehensive performance.
Conventionally, to design a hybrid modulation, harmonic approach or piecewise
approach is used, but they suffer from time-consuming model building process
and inaccuracy. Therefore, an artificial-intelligence-based hybrid extended
phase shift (HEPS) modulation is proposed. Generally, the HEPS modulation is
developed in an automated fashion, which alleviates cumbersome model building
process while keeping high model accuracy. In HEPS modulation, two EPS
strategies are considered to realize optimal efficiency with full ZVS operation
over entire operating ranges. Specifically, to build data-driven models of ZVS
and efficiency performance, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), which is a
state-of-the-art ensemble learning algorithm, is adopted. Afterwards, particle
swarm optimization with state-based adaptive velocity limit (PSO-SAVL) is
utilized to select the best EPS strategy and optimize modulation parameters.
With 1 kW hardware experiments, the feasibility of HEPS has been verified,
achieving optimal efficiency with maximum of 97.1% and full-range ZVS
operation."
18,Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Battery Conditioning Hierarchical V2G Coordination for Multi-Stakeholder Benefits,Systems and Control,Yubao Zhang; Xin Chen; Yi Gu; Zhicheng Li; Wu Kai,01-August-2023,"With the growing prevalence of electric vehicles (EVs) and advancements in EV
electronics, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) techniques and large-scale scheduling
strategies have emerged to promote renewable energy utilization and power grid
stability. This study proposes a multi-stakeholder hierarchical V2G
coordination based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and the Proof of Stake
algorithm. Furthermore, the multi-stakeholders include the power grid, EV
aggregators (EVAs), and users, and the proposed strategy can achieve
multi-stakeholder benefits. On the grid side, load fluctuations and renewable
energy consumption are considered, while on the EVA side, energy constraints
and charging costs are considered. The three critical battery conditioning
parameters of battery SOX are considered on the user side, including state of
charge, state of power, and state of health. Compared with four typical
baselines, the multi-stakeholder hierarchical coordination strategy can enhance
renewable energy consumption, mitigate load fluctuations, meet the energy
demands of EVA, and reduce charging costs and battery degradation under
realistic operating conditions."
19,Robust Electric Vehicle Balancing of Autonomous Mobility-On-Demand System: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach,Multiagent Systems,Sihong He; Shuo Han; Fei Miao,30-July-2023,"Electric autonomous vehicles (EAVs) are getting attention in future
autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems due to their economic and societal
benefits. However, EAVs' unique charging patterns (long charging time, high
charging frequency, unpredictable charging behaviors, etc.) make it challenging
to accurately predict the EAVs supply in E-AMoD systems. Furthermore, the
mobility demand's prediction uncertainty makes it an urgent and challenging
task to design an integrated vehicle balancing solution under supply and demand
uncertainties. Despite the success of reinforcement learning-based E-AMoD
balancing algorithms, state uncertainties under the EV supply or mobility
demand remain unexplored. In this work, we design a multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL)-based framework for EAVs balancing in E-AMoD systems, with
adversarial agents to model both the EAVs supply and mobility demand
uncertainties that may undermine the vehicle balancing solutions. We then
propose a robust E-AMoD Balancing MARL (REBAMA) algorithm to train a robust
EAVs balancing policy to balance both the supply-demand ratio and charging
utilization rate across the whole city. Experiments show that our proposed
robust method performs better compared with a non-robust MARL method that does
not consider state uncertainties; it improves the reward, charging utilization
fairness, and supply-demand fairness by 19.28%, 28.18%, and 3.97%,
respectively. Compared with a robust optimization-based method, the proposed
MARL algorithm can improve the reward, charging utilization fairness, and
supply-demand fairness by 8.21%, 8.29%, and 9.42%, respectively."
20,Artificial-Intelligence-Based Design for Circuit Parameters of Power Converters,Signal Processing,X. Li; X. Zhang; F. Lin; F. Blaabjerg,30-July-2023,"Parameter design is significant in ensuring a satisfactory holistic
performance of power converters. Generally, circuit parameter design for power
converters consists of two processes: analysis and deduction process and
optimization process. The existing approaches for parameter design consist of
two types: traditional approach and computer-aided optimization (CAO) approach.
In the traditional approaches, heavy human-dependence is required. Even though
the emerging CAO approaches automate the optimization process, they still
require manual analysis and deduction process. To mitigate human-dependence for
the sake of high accuracy and easy implementation, an
artificial-intelligence-based design (AI-D) approach is proposed in this
article for the parameter design of power converters. In the proposed AI-D
approach, to achieve automation in the analysis and deduction process,
simulation tools and batch-normalization neural network (BN-NN) are adopted to
build data-driven models for the optimization objectives and design
constraints. Besides, to achieve automation in the optimization process,
genetic algorithm is used to search for optimal design results. The proposed
AI-D approach is validated in the circuit parameter design of the synchronous
buck converter in the 48 to 12 V accessory-load power supply system in electric
vehicle. The design case of an efficiency-optimal synchronous buck converter
with constraints in volume, voltage ripple, and current ripple is provided. In
the end of this article, feasibility and accuracy of the proposed AI-D approach
have been validated by hardware experiments."
21,Symmetric separable convex resource allocation problems with structured disjoint interval bound constraints,Optimization and Control,Martijn H. H. Schoot Uiterkamp,28-July-2023,"Motivated by the problem of scheduling electric vehicle (EV) charging with a
minimum charging threshold in smart distribution grids, we introduce the
resource allocation problem (RAP) with a symmetric separable convex objective
function and disjoint interval bound constraints. In this RAP, the aim is to
allocate an amount of resource over a set of $n$ activities, where each
individual allocation is restricted to a disjoint collection of $m$ intervals.
This is a generalization of classical RAPs studied in the literature where in
contrast each allocation is only restricted by simple lower and upper bounds,
i.e., $m=1$. We propose an exact algorithm that, for four special cases of the
problem, returns an optimal solution in $O \left(\binom{n+m-2}{m-2} (n \log n +
nF) \right)$ time, where the term $nF$ represents the number of flops required
for one evaluation of the separable objective function. In particular, the
algorithm runs in polynomial time when the number of intervals $m$ is fixed.
Moreover, we show how this algorithm can be adapted to also output an optimal
solution to the problem with integer variables without increasing its time
complexity. Computational experiments demonstrate the practical efficiency of
the algorithm for small values of $m$ and in particular for solving EV charging
problems."
22,Bi-level Network Design for UAM Vertiport Allocation Using Activity-Based Transport Simulations,Multiagent Systems,Sebastian Brulin; Markus Olhofer,27-July-2023,"The design or the optimization of transport systems is a difficult task. This
is especially true in the case of the introduction of new transport modes in an
existing system. The main reason is, that even small additions and changes
result in the emergence of new travel patterns, likely resulting in an
adaptation of the travel behavior of multiple other agents in the system. Here
we consider the optimization of future Urban Air Mobility services under
consideration of effects induced by the new mode to an existing system. We
tackle this problem through a bi-level network design approach, in which the
discrete decisions of the network design planner are optimized based on the
evaluated dynamic demand of the user's mode choices. We solve the
activity-based network design problem (AB-NDP) using a Genetic Algorithm on a
multi-objective optimization problem while evaluating the dynamic demand with
the large-scale Multi-Agent Transport Simulation (MATSim) framework. The
proposed bi-level approach is compared against the results of a coverage
approach using a static demand method. The bi-level study shows better results
for expected UAM demand and total travel time savings across the transportation
system. Due to its generic character, the demonstrated utilization of a
bi-level method is applicable to other mobility service design questions and to
other regions."
23,Overcoming voltage fluctuation in electric vehicles by considering Al electrolytic capacitor-based voltage stabilizer,Systems and Control,Ida Hamidah; Doni Fajar Ramadhan; Ramdhani Ramdhani; Budi Mulyanti; Roer Eka Pawinanto; Lilik Hasanah; Asep Bayu Dani Nandiyanto; Jumril Yunas; Andrivo Rusydi,21-July-2023,"Battery pack used in electrical vehicles (EVs) have developed fastly nowadays
and are important due to its capability to stores electric charge. However, it
is still found that there is an electrical voltage fluctuations due to sudden
load changes or faults in the power system. To overcome this problem, the
conventional strategy focuses on using voltage stabilizer with
inductor-capacitor resonant circuits, leaving the problem of using capacitors
at cryogenic temperatures. Herewith, we design a vehicle automatic voltage
stabilizer (VAVS) operating at room temperature. The VAVS consists of nine main
components, including resistors, capacitors, transistors, and diodes arranged
with a specific composition to stabilize the voltage. By considering Al
electrolytic capacitor, type of diode, resistor, and transistor, the VAVS
device stabilizes the input voltage from 10-15V to obtain an output voltage of
12V. Then, by varying the engine rotation speed of vehicle, VAVS applied in
vehicle battery supplies a constant voltage of about 12.1 V. The lowest line
regulation analysis reveals a regulated voltage fluctuation of 0.17%/V. Our
result shows that VAVS design works at room temperature, overcomes the voltage
fluctuation and complies with the standard regulation of voltage stabilizers."
24,SMOTEC: An Edge Computing Testbed for Adaptive Smart Mobility Experimentation,"Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing",Zeinab Nezami; Evangelos Pournaras; Amir Borzouie; Jie Xu,20-July-2023,"Smart mobility becomes paramount for meeting net-zero targets. However,
autonomous, self-driving and electric vehicles require more than ever before an
efficient, resilient and trustworthy computational offloading backbone that
expands throughout the edge-to-cloud continuum. Utilizing on-demand
heterogeneous computational resources for smart mobility is challenging and
often cost-ineffective. This paper introduces SMOTEC, a novel open-source
testbed for adaptive smart mobility experimentation with edge computing. SMOTEC
provides for the first time a modular end-to-end instrumentation for
prototyping and optimizing placement of intelligence services on edge devices
such as augmented reality and real-time traffic monitoring. SMOTEC supports a
plug-and-play Docker container integration of the SUMO simulator for urban
mobility, Raspberry Pi edge devices communicating via ZeroMQ and EPOS for an
AI-based decentralized load balancing across edge-to-cloud. All components are
orchestrated by the K3s lightweight Kubernetes. A proof-of-concept of

25,Decentralized Smart Charging of Large-Scale EVs using Adaptive Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits,Machine Learning,Sharyal Zafar; Raphaël Feraud; Anne Blavette; Guy Camilleri; Hamid Ben,20-July-2023,"The drastic growth of electric vehicles and photovoltaics can introduce new
challenges, such as electrical current congestion and voltage limit violations
due to peak load demands. These issues can be mitigated by controlling the
operation of electric vehicles i.e., smart charging. Centralized smart charging
solutions have already been proposed in the literature. But such solutions may
lack scalability and suffer from inherent drawbacks of centralization, such as
a single point of failure, and data privacy concerns. Decentralization can help
tackle these challenges. In this paper, a fully decentralized smart charging
system is proposed using the philosophy of adaptive multi-agent systems. The
proposed system utilizes multi-armed bandit learning to handle uncertainties in
the system. The presented system is decentralized, scalable, real-time,
model-free, and takes fairness among different players into account. A detailed
case study is also presented for performance evaluation."
26,Forecasting Battery Electric Vehicle Charging Behavior: A Deep Learning Approach Equipped with Micro-Clustering and SMOTE Techniques,Machine Learning,Hanif Tayarani; Trisha V. Ramadoss; Vaishnavi Karanam; Gil Tal; Christopher Nitta,20-July-2023,"Energy systems, climate change, and public health are among the primary
reasons for moving toward electrification in transportation. Transportation
electrification is being promoted worldwide to reduce emissions. As a result,
many automakers will soon start making only battery electric vehicles (BEVs).
BEV adoption rates are rising in California, mainly due to climate change and
air pollution concerns. While great for climate and pollution goals, improperly
managed BEV charging can lead to insufficient charging infrastructure and power
outages. This study develops a novel Micro Clustering Deep Neural Network
(MCDNN), an artificial neural network algorithm that is highly effective at
learning BEVs trip and charging data to forecast BEV charging events,
information that is essential for electricity load aggregators and utility
managers to provide charging stations and electricity capacity effectively. The
MCDNN is configured using a robust dataset of trips and charges that occurred
in California between 2015 and 2020 from 132 BEVs, spanning 5 BEV models for a
total of 1570167 vehicle miles traveled. The numerical findings revealed that
the proposed MCDNN is more effective than benchmark approaches in this field,
such as support vector machine, k nearest neighbors, decision tree, and other
neural network-based models in predicting the charging events."
27,Distributed photovoltaics provides key benefits for a highly renewable European energy system,Physics and Society,Parisa Rahdan; Elisabeth Zeyen; Cristobal Gallego-Castillo; Marta Victoria,19-July-2023,"Distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are projected to be a key
contributor to future energy landscape, but are often poorly represented in
energy models due to their distributed nature. They have higher costs compared
to utility PV, but offer additional advantages, e.g., in terms of social
acceptance. Here, we model the European power network with a high spatial
resolution of 181 nodes and a 2-hourly temporal resolution. We use a simplified
model of distribution and transmission networks that allows the representation
of power distribution losses and differentiates between utility and distributed
generation and storage. Three scenarios, including a sector-coupled scenario
with heating, transport, and industry are investigated. The results show that
incorporating distributed solar PV leads to total system cost reduction in all
scenarios (1.4% for power sector, 1.9-3.7% for sector-coupled). The achieved
cost reductions primarily stem from demand peak reduction and lower
distribution capacity requirements because of self-consumption from distributed
solar. This also enhances self-sufficiency for countries. The role of
distributed PV is noteworthy in the sector-coupled scenario and is helped by
other distributed technologies including heat pumps and electric vehicle
batteries."
28,Uncovering Load-Altering Attacks Against N-1 Secure Power Grids: A Rare-Event Sampling Approach,Systems and Control,Maldon Patrice Goodridge; Subhash Lakshminarayana; Alessandro Zocca,17-July-2023,"Load-altering attacks targetting a large number of IoT-based high-wattage
devices (e.g., smart electric vehicle charging stations) can lead to serious
disruptions of power grid operations. In this work, we aim to uncover
spatiotemporal characteristics of LAAs that can lead to serious impact. The
problem is challenging since existing protection measures such as $N-1$
security ensures that the power grid is naturally resilient to load changes.
Thus, strategically injected load perturbations that lead to network failure
can be regarded as \emph{rare events}. To this end, we adopt a rare-event
sampling approach to uncover LAAs distributed temporally and spatially across
the power network. The key advantage of this sampling method is the ability of
sampling efficiently from multi-modal conditional distributions with
disconnected support. Furthermore, we systematically compare the impacts of
static (one-time manipulation of demand) and dynamic (attack over multiple time
periods) LAAs. We perform extensive simulations using benchmark IEEE test
simulations. The results show (i) the superiority and the need for rare-event
sampling in the context of uncovering LAAs as compared to other sampling
methodologies, (ii) statistical analysis of attack characteristics and impacts
of static and dynamic LAAs, and (iii) cascade sizes (due to LAA) for different
network sizes and load conditions."
29,A Two-Layers Predictive Algorithm for Workplace EV Charging,Systems and Control,Saif Ahmad; Jochem Baltussen; Pauline Kergus; Zohra Kader; Stéphane Caux,17-July-2023,"In this paper, the problem of electric vehicle (EV) charging at the workplace
is addressed via a two-layer predictive algorithm. We consider a time of use
(TOU) pricing model for energy drawn from the grid and try to minimize the
charging cost incurred by the EV charging station (EVCS) operator via an
economic layer based on dynamic programming (DP) approach. An adaptive
prediction algorithm based on a non-parametric stochastic model computes the
projected EV load demand over the day which helps in the selection of optimal
loading policy for the EVs in the economic layer. The second layer is a
scheduling algorithm designed to share the allocated power limit (obtained from
economic layer) among the charging EVs during each charge cycle. The modeling
and validation is performed using ACN data-set from Caltech. Comparison of the
proposed scheme with a conventional DP algorithm illustrates its effectiveness
in terms of supplying the requested energy despite lacking user input for
departure time."
